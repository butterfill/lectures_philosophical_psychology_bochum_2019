      The puzzle here is twofold.
      [a] Categorical perception of speech happens rapidly, and goal-directed actions
      are complex.  How can something so complex be computed so quickly?
      [b] How could you recover articulatory gestures from acoustic and visual inputs?

        Before facing this problem directly, I want to think about action more generally ...


Must work in Tuebingen seminar with three questions about action (because the questions approach is good)

Seeing causal interactions as a route into metacognitive feelings of surprise?

Perceptual stuff:
  - seeing red
  - perceiving emotions
  - perceiving causal interactions
  - speech perception
  - action experience

Experiments:
  - false belief with Jason
  - joint action with John


Introduce a unit on decision theory, RPT, instrumental rationality and dual-process theory of action? (How would this fit with the three questions idea?) Also models and construals (triggered by puzzle about whether agnostic about processes)?

TODO
====
  Should we be instrumentally rational? (implications of dual process theories of (i) motivational states, and (ii) processes underpinning ethical judgements)
  mindreading and motor representation (use ICPS, talk about Edwards & Low 2018 onwards)

PLAN
====
01 seeing red? [71]
02 what are metacognitive feelings? (Docic vs me) [44]
03 perceiving feelings? [move sharing smiles to interaction] [83]

04 perceiving causal interactions? [148]
05 What is the mark of agency? [tuebingen questions, motor determines goal-directedness [no interface]] [78]
06 decision theory and processes [218]

   [MINDREADING DAY]
07 three questions about mindreading [103]
08 a dual process theory [43]
09 the method of signature limits [93]

10 speech and motor / the double life of motor representation [puzzles] [49]
11 motor theory goal tracking [93]
12 Is There a Role for Motor Processes in Mindreading? [24] !!!TODO***

13 twin interface problems
14 experience of action (own and others)?
15 sharing a smile

radical interpretation [problems] / Should we be instrumentally rational?
interaction as a route to knowledge? [smile/ygimg]


Questions
  Do humans perceive categorical colour properties?
  Do humans perceive causal interactions?
  Do humans perceive others’ feelings?
    Categorical perception of speech happens raidly, and goal-directed actions are complex.  How can something so complex be computed so quickly?
  What are those motor representations doing there?
  What do we experience of action?
  How should we solve the twin interface problems? (Why do you have experience?)
  What do infants, chimps and scrub-jays reason about, or represent, that enables them, within limits, to track others’ perceptions, knowledge, beliefs and other mental states?
  Why is belief-tracking in adults sometimes but not always automatic? 
  How could belief-tracking be automatic given evidence that it depends on working memory and consumes attention?
  How do observations about tracking support conclusions about representing?
  Why are there dissociations in nonhuman apes’, human infants’ and human adults’ performance on belief-tracking tasks?
  How are mindreading and motor representation related?
  What is the mark of agency?
  What is categorical perception?
  Is there a route to knowledge of others’ minds that depends on interaction?
  What are metacognitive feelings?

1. Decision Theory

  intro to decision theory using (lecture 3 or 5)
  https://philosophical-issues-in-behavioural-science.butterfill.com/lecture_03.html#slide-152

https://philosophical-issues-in-behavioural-science.butterfill.com/lecture_03.html#habitual_instrumental

  puzzle about action
  dual process theory

  Have we shown that decision theory is wrong?

  Puzzle: The range of applications of Decision Theory shows it is agnostic
  about processes. BUT Dickinson’s instrumental process is characterised by
  appeal to Decision Theory.

  Solution: construals

Aim: get to the two systems/metacognition issues discussed in London
  http://www.butterfill.com/talk-slides/london_metacognition_2017/#slide-16

This requires (i) the identity limit; (ii) the developmental discrepancy

Mindreading in nonhumans: What is theory of mind anyway?
Mindreading in humans: automaticity motivates efficiency motivates MtM, leads to prediction about signature limits, which has successfully been tested.

Use London metacog talk and Tueb talk
 - go with Tuebingen as far as the CLSTX+ conjecture and then the puzzle that motivates metacognitive feelings; prepare to stop here
 - switch to London talk.
 - [part of the idea is to contrast a minimally dual process view with modularity/core systems]
 - expand 2 systems presentation
   - motivate by referring back to earlier discussion of modularity and core systems
   - return explicitly back to Wynn’s mouse
