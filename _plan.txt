    p.notes.handout.show How could the objects of categorical perception of speech be articulatory gestures?

      The puzzle here is twofold.
      [a] Categorical perception of speech happens raidly, and goal-directed actions
      are complex.  How can something so complex be computed so quickly?
      [b] How could you recover articulatory gestures from acoustic and visual inputs?

        Before facing this problem directly, I want to think about action more generally ...


Must work in Tuebingen seminar with three questions about action (because the questions approach is good)

Seeing causal interactions as a route into metacognitive feelings of surprise?

Perceptual stuff:
  - seeing red
  - perceiving emotions
  - perceiving causal interactions
  - speech perception
  - action experience

Experiments:
  - false belief with Jason
  - joint action with John


Introduce a unit on decision theory, RPT, instrumental rationality and dual-process theory of action? (How would this fit with the three questions idea?)

Aim: get to the two systems/metacognition issues discussed in London
  http://www.butterfill.com/talk-slides/london_metacognition_2017/#slide-16

This requires (i) the identity limit; (ii) the developmental discrepancy

Mindreading in nonhumans: What is theory of mind anyway?
Mindreading in humans: automaticity motivates efficiency motivates MtM, leads to prediction about signature limits, which has successfully been tested.

Use London metacog talk and Tueb talk
 - go with Tuebingen as far as the CLSTX+ conjecture and then the puzzle that motivates metacognitive feelings; prepare to stop here
 - switch to London talk.
 - [part of the idea is to contrast a minimally dual process view with modularity/core systems]
 - expand 2 systems presentation
   - motivate by referring back to earlier discussion of modularity and core systems
   - return explicitly back to Wynn’s mouse
