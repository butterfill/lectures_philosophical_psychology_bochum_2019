      The puzzle here is twofold.
      [a] Categorical perception of speech happens rapidly, and goal-directed actions
      are complex.  How can something so complex be computed so quickly?
      [b] How could you recover articulatory gestures from acoustic and visual inputs?

        Before facing this problem directly, I want to think about action more generally ...



Seeing causal interactions as a route into metacognitive feelings of surprise?

Perceptual stuff:
  - seeing red
  - perceiving emotions
  - perceiving causal interactions
  - speech perception
  - action experience

Experiments:
  - false belief with Jason
  - joint action with John



TODO
====
  Evidence for mTgt -- in particular, that mTgt influences judgements (disorders, etc)
  Should we be instrumentally rational? Add something on (ii) processes underpinning ethical judgements? [Not sure what I had in mind]

Questions
  Do humans perceive categorical colour properties?
  Do humans perceive causal interactions?
  Do humans perceive others’ feelings?
    Categorical perception of speech happens raidly, and goal-directed actions are complex.  How can something so complex be computed so quickly?
  What are those motor representations doing there?
  What do we experience of action?
  How should we solve the twin interface problems? (Why do you have experience?)
  What do infants, chimps and scrub-jays reason about, or represent, that enables them, within limits, to track others’ perceptions, knowledge, beliefs and other mental states?
  Why is belief-tracking in adults sometimes but not always automatic? 
  How could belief-tracking be automatic given evidence that it depends on working memory and consumes attention?
  How do observations about tracking support conclusions about representing?
  Why are there dissociations in nonhuman apes’, human infants’ and human adults’ performance on belief-tracking tasks?
  How are mindreading and motor representation related?
  What is the mark of agency?
  What is categorical perception?
  Is there a route to knowledge of others’ minds that depends on interaction?
  What are metacognitive feelings?

  puzzle about action
  dual process theory

  Have we shown that decision theory is wrong?

  Puzzle: The range of applications of Decision Theory shows it is agnostic
  about processes. BUT Dickinson’s instrumental process is characterised by
  appeal to Decision Theory.

  Solution: construals
