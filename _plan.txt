Aim: get to the two systems/metacognition issues discussed in London
  http://www.butterfill.com/talk-slides/london_metacognition_2017/#slide-16

This requires (i) the identity limit; (ii) the developmental discrepancy

Mindreading in nonhumans: What is theory of mind anyway?
Mindreading in humans: automaticity motivates efficiency motivates MtM, leads to prediction about signature limits, which has successfully been tested.

Use London metacog talk and Tueb talk
 - go with Tuebingen as far as the CLSTX+ conjecture and then the puzzle that motivates metacognitive feelings; prepare to stop here
 - switch to London talk.
 - [part of the idea is to contrast a minimally dual process view with modularity/core systems]
 - expand 2 systems presentation
   - motivate by referring back to earlier discussion of modularity and core systems
   - return explicitly back to Wynn’s mouse
