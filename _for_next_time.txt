Might start with something on the nature of folk psychology.
Reading: Stich, Stephen, and Ian Ravenscroft. “What Is Folk Psychology?” Cognition 50, no. 1–3 (April 1994): 447–68. doi:10.1016/0010-0277(94)90040-X.

Also good: controversy about intuitive physics (Kubricht et al, 2017). Seems this motivates a good theory of implicit/explicit or dual processes.

Metacognitive feelings (London talk)

    * What is folk psychology?
    * Dual process theories of mindreading
    * Modularity, Core Knowledge and the Linking Problem
    * The Interface Problem
    * Metacognitive feelings
    * Drawn together: motor representation in joint action
