What evidence might bear on whether ‘[w]e sometimes {see} aspects of each others’ mental lives, and thereby come to have non-inferential knowledge of them’ \citealp[p.\ 573]{mcneill:2012_embodiment}?



\section{Categorical Perception \& Emotion}

There is a way of categorising static pictures of faces and other stimuli according to which emotion
someone might think they are expressing: some faces are happy, others fearful, and so on
From five months of age,
or possibly much earlier \citep{field:1982_discrimination},
through to adulthood, humans are better at distinguishing faces when they
differ with respect to these categories than when they do not
\citep{Etcoff:1992zd,Gelder:1997bf,Bornstein:2003vq,Kotsoni:2001ph,cheal:2011_categorical,hoonhorst:2011_categoricala}.

The patterns of discrimination do not appear to be an artefact of linguistic labels
(\citealp{sauter:2011_categorical}; see also \citealp{laukka:2005_categorical}, p.\ 291),%
nor of the particular choices subjects in these experiments are presented with \citep{bimler:2001_categorical,fujimura:2011_categorical}.
Nor are the patterns of discrimination due to narrowly visual features of the stimuli used \citep{sato:2009_detection}.

‘at a mean latency of 140 ms) the N170 showed both amplitude and latency
modulation differentially with emotional expressions. ...
[BUT] Whether this is due presently to low-level stimulus factors or to the use of emotional faces
is still to be determined’ \citep[p.~616]{batty:2003_early}.



\section{The Objects of Categorical Perception}

The same facial configuration can express intense joy or intense anguish depending on the posture of
the body it is attached to; and humans cannot accurately determine emotions from
spontaneously occurring (as opposed to acted out) facial
configurations \citep{motley:1988_facial,aviezer:2008_angry,aviezer:2012_body}.

Aviezer et al's puzzle:
Given that  facial configurations are not diagnostic of emotion, why  are they categorised by perceptual processes?

‘emotions are episodic modes of evaluative engagement with the social and practical world’
\citep[p.\ 1512]{parkinson:2008_emotions}.


\section{Speech Perception}

\emph{Articulatory Gesture:}
In speaking we produce an overlapping sequence of articulatory gestures, which are motor actions
involving coordinated movements of the lips, tongue, velum and larynx. These gestures are the units
in terms of which we plan utterances \citep{Browman:1992da,Goldstein:2003bn}.

A
phenomenon called “duplex” perception suggests that speech and auditory processing are distinct \citep{Liberman:1981xk}.

Some hold that the things categorised in categorical perception of speech are not sounds or movements (say) but rather these outcomes---the very outcomes in terms of which speech actions are represented motorically (\citealp{Liberman:2000gr}; see also \citealp{Browman:1992da}).
 

\section{Emotion vs Speech}
\emph{Wild conjecture}: 
the things categorical perception is supposed to categorise, the ‘expressions of emotion’, are actions of a certain type, and these are categorised by which outcomes they are directed to.

The wild conjecture implies that:
\begin{itemize}
 \item the things categorised in categorical perception of expressions of emotion are events rather than configurations or anything static;
\item  these events are not mere physiological reactions (as we might intuitively take blushing to be) but things like frowning and smiling, whose performance involves motor expertise; and
\item  these events are perceptually categorised  by the outcomes to which they are directed.
\end{itemize}

\section{Questions}

1. What does evidence for categorical perception of expressions of emotion tell us about whether we sometimes perceive aspects of others’ mental lives?

2. If emotions are perceived, what model of the emotions captures them from the point of view of the perceiver?

3. How do speech and action perception relate to perceptual encounters with expressions of emotion?
