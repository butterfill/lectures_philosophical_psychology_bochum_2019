‘When we consider these objects with the utmost attention, we find only
that one body approaches the other; and that the motion of it precedes
that of the other, but without any sensible interval.’ \citep[p.~77]{Hume:1739lj}

‘the account flies in the face of our common-sense conviction that we do
perceive causal relations all the time. The experience of perceiving one
event following another is really quite different from the experience of
perceiving the second event as caused by the first ... the researches of Michotte and Piaget would seem to support our
common-sense view’
\citep[pp.~114-5]{Searle:1983tx}

Sometimes ‘a causal impression arises, clear,
genuine, and unmistakable, and the idea of cause can be derived from it
… in just the same way as the idea of shape or movement can be derived
from the perception of shape or movement.’
\citep[p.~270--1]{Michotte:1946nz}

‘the causal perception is the perception of the work of a mechanical force,
just as the impression of the movement of a car is the perception of its
displacement in physical space’
\citep[p.~228]{Michotte:1946nz}

‘This causal impression, however, would have been for him [Hume] ...
nothing but an illusion of the senses, as is shown by his
views with regard to the feeling of effort. ... [I]t is probable that his
[Hume’s] philosophical position would not have been affected in the
least.’
\citep[p.~256]{Michotte:1946nz}

‘In a great boulder rolling down the mountainside and flattening the wooden hut in its path we see an exemplary instance of force … these mechanical transactions … are directly observable (or experienceable)’
\citep[p.~118]{Strawson:1992yh}

‘just as the visual system works to recover … physical structure … by inferring properties such as 3-D shape, so too does it work to recover … causal … structure … by inferring properties such as causality’
\citep[p.~299]{Scholl:2000eq}

‘we seem to be as far as ever from deciding whether the hypothesis is
true: whether we perceive launchings rather than recognizing them by
means of stored patterns in long-term memory.’
\citep[p.~92]{rips:2011_causation}




\section{How to Get Beyond Intuition?}


Consider an encounter with three two-object movements where the delays between movements are 50, 100 and 150ms:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The phenomenal difference between the first two encounters is larger than the phenomenal difference between the second two.
\item This difference in differences is a fact in need of explanation.
\item The fact cannot be explained by perceptual experience of objects or their motion.
\item The best explanation for (1) is that we perceptually experience causal interactions.
\end{enumerate}

‘… why it is that in our experiments certain particular conditions were
found necessary in order to give rise to a causal impression? They
correspond to the different characteristics of reproduction. …
anyone not very familiar with the procedure involved in framing the
physical concepts of inertia, energy, conservation of energy, etc., might
think that these concepts are simply derived from the data of immediate
experience’
\citep{Michotte:1946nz}

Further questions:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item How is launching detected? For example, does it involve perceptual processes?
\item Why is a delay of up to around 70ms consistent with the launching effect occuring?
\end{enumerate}



\section{The Launching Effect and Perceptual Processes}

Does the detection of launching involve perceptual processes?  Three kinds of evidence
indicates that it does ...

1. Apparent motion \citep{kim:2013_perceived}

2. Adaptation? (conflicting evidence: \citet{rolfs:2013_visual} for, \citet{arnold:2015_objectcentered} against).

3. Illusory causal crescents. ‘when there is a launching event beneath the overlap (or underlap event) timed such that
the launch occurs at the point of maximum overlap, observers inaccurately report that
the overlap is incomplete, suggesting that they see an illusory crescent.’
\citep[p.\ 461]{Scholl:2004dx}

Why does the illusory causal crescent appear?  Scholl and Nakayama suggest a
‘a simple categorical explanation for the Causal Crescents illusion: the visual system,
when led by other means to perceive an event as a causal collision, effectively
‘refuses’ to see the two objects as fully overlapped, because of an internalized
constraint to the effect that such a spatial arrangement is not physically possible.
As a result, a thin crescent of one object remains uncovered by the other one-as
would in fact be the case in a straight-on billiard-ball collision where the motion
occurs at an angle close to the line of sight.’
\citep[p.\ 466]{Scholl:2004dx}

‘object perception reflects basic constraints on the motions of physical bodies …’
\citep[p.\ 51]{Spelke:1990jn}

‘A single system of  knowledge  … appears to underlie object perception and physical reasoning’
\citep[p.\ 175]{Carey:1994bh}



\section{Object Indexes}


\subsection{Michotte’s Conjecture}
Michotte thought of the launching effect as bound up  with the perception of 
objects and motion.

‘the movement performed by object B appears simultaneously under two
different guises: (i) as a movement (belonging to object A), (ii) as a
change in relative position (by object B)’
\citep[p.~136]{Michotte:1946nz}

‘the physical movement of the object struck gives rise to a double
representation. This movement appears at one and the same time (a) as a
continuation of the previous movement of the motor object, and (b) as a
change of relative position (a purely spatial withdrawal) of the projectile
in relation to the motor object.’
\citep[p.~140]{Michotte:1946nz}

\subsection{Object Indexes}
In adult humans,
there is a system of object indexes which enables them to track potentially moving objects in ongoing actions such as visually tracking or
reaching for objects, and which influences how their attention is allocated
\citep{flombaum:2008_attentional}.

Formally, an object index is ‘a mental token that functions as a
pointer to an object’ \citep[p.\ 11]{Leslie:1998zk}.
If you imagine using your fingers to track moving objects,
an object index is the mental counterpart of a finger \citep[p.~68]{pylyshyn:1989_role}.

Why believe that object indexes exist in adult humans?
One reason is that they can track at least four moving objects simultaneously
(\citealp{pylyshyn:1988_tracking}; there is debate about exactly how many objects can be tracked simultaneously \citep{alvarez:2007_how}.)

Another reason is the existence of an  \emph{object-specific preview benefit}: ‘observers can identify target
letters that matched the preview letter from the same object faster than
they can identify target letters that matched the preview letter from the
other object’ (\citealp[p.~2]{Krushke:1996ge}; see \citealp{Kahneman:1992xt}).

This system of object indexes
does not involve belief or knowledge
and may assign indexes to objects in ways that are inconsistent with
a subject’s beliefs about the identities of objects
\citep[e.g.][]{Mitroff:2004pc, mitroff:2007_space}


\subsection{The Principles of Object Perception}
 
cohesion—‘two surface points lie on the same object only if the points are linked by a path of 
connected surface points’
 
boundedness—‘two surface points lie on distinct objects only if no path of connected surface points 
links them’
 
rigidity—‘objects are interpreted as moving rigidly if such an interpretation exists’
 
no action at a distance—‘separated objects are interpreted as moving independently of one another if such an 
interpretation exists’ \citep{Spelke:1990jn}
 

\section{Object Indexes and the Launching Effect}

\emph{Causal Object Index Conjecture}:
Effects associated with the ‘perception of causation’
are consequences of errors (or error-like patterns) in the assignments of object indexes and
their phenomenal effects \citep[compare][]{Krushke:1996ge}.


Implications:
(i) Where there is perception of causation, there will be errors (or error-like patterns)
in the assignments of object indexes.
(ii) Factors that can influence how object indexes are assigned or maintained can influence
perception of causation.



‘Michotte and his followers worked out many of the factors which mediate
the perception of causality, such as the role of absolute and relative
speeds, spatial and temporal gaps in the objects' trajectories, differences
in the durations and angles of each object's trajectory, etc ...
‘This research has generally shown that many different  spatiotemporal parameters are critical for perceiving causality, but  that featural parameters (eg colors, shapes, sizes) play little or no role.’
\citep[p.~456]{Scholl:2004dx}

Potential objections to the Causal Object Index Conjecture: 

Objection 1. adaptation effects \citep{rolfs:2013_visual}.
But see \citet{johnston:2013_causality,arnold:2015_objectcentered} for questions.

Objection 2. ‘Leslie’s [Pulfrich double-pendulum illusion \citep{wilson:1986_impossibly,Leslie:1988ct}] argument suggests
that people individuate objects and calculate their causal relations by
means of separate mechanisms; thus, we can’t count on causal constraints
being part of the object-tracking module. If Leslie is right, there is
reason to question Butterfill’s (2009) conjecture that ‘object
perception and causal perception are one and the same process’’ \citep[p.~421]{rips:2011_causation}.


\section{The Launching Effect and Metacognition}
If the launching effect is a consequence of the operation
of a system of object indexes, why does it have phenomenal consequences?
One possibility is that conflicts in assigning object indexes give rise to metacognitive feelings
of surprise 
which subjects have learnt to interpret as impressions of causation.
