\section{An Interface Problem}
 
Interface problem: How does it come about that intentions and motor representations
ever specify outcomes that non-accidentally match?

Why is this question a problem? Because intentions and motor representations are not
inferentially integrated (perhaps because of differences in representational format).
 
Two collections of outcomes, A and B, \emph{match} in a particular context just if, in that context,
either the occurrence of the A-outcomes would normally constitute or cause, at least partially, the
occurrence of the B-outcomes or vice versa. To illustrate, one way of matching is for the B-outcomes
to be the A-outcomes. Another way of matching is for the B-outcomes to stand to the A-outcomes as
elements of a more detailed plan stand to those of a less detailed one.

‘both mundane cases of action slips and pathological conditions, such as apraxia or anarchic hand
syndrome (AHS), illustrate the existence of an interface problem’ 
\citep[p.~7]{mylopoulos:2016_intentions}.
 
 
 
\section{Five Complications}
 
It’s ‘not just how motor representations are triggered by intentions, but how motor
representations’ sometimes nonaccidentally continue to match intentions as circumstances change in unforeseen ways ‘throughout
skill execution’
\citep[p.~19]{fridland:2016_skill}.
 
 
 
\section{Mylopoulos and Pacherie’s Proposal}
 
‘As defined by Tutiya et al., an executable concept of a type of movement is a
representation, that could guide the formation of a volition, itself the proximal cause of
a corresponding movement. Possession of an executable concept of a type of movement thus
implies a capacity to form volitions that cause the production of movements that are
instances of that type.’
\citep[p.~7]{pacherie:2011_nonconceptual}
