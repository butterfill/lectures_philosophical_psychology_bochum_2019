    both the models and the processes  involved in mindreading.

            A \emph{signature limit of a model} is a set of predictions derivable from the model which are
            incorrect, and which are not predictions of other models under consideration.

  .notes: :t
    Signature limits are important in two ways.
    First, they generate predictions.
    And second, they allow us to test hypotheses linking particular kinds of mindreading
    process across developmental time.

    .notes: :t
      There is  some evidence that this prediction is correct.
      Jason Low and his collegaues set out to test it.
      They have now published three 
      different papers showing such limits; and Hannes Rakoczy and others 
      have more work in progress on this.
      Collapsing several experiements using different approaches,
      the basic pattern of their findings is this ...
    .notes: :t
      Take non-automatic responses first; in this case, communicative responses.
      When you do a false-belief-identity task, you see the pattern you also
      find for false-belief-locations tasks.
      But things look different when you measure non-automatic responses ...
    .notes: :t()
      The non-automatic responses all show the signature limit of minimal
      models of the mental.
      This is evidence for the hypothesis that 
      Some automatic belief-tracking systems rely on minimal models of the mental.
    .notes: :t()
      I also hear that quite a few scientists have pilot data that speaks
      against this signature limit.
    .notes: :t()
      One particular task for future research will be to examine whether other
      automatic responses to scenarios involving false beliefs about identity,
      such as response times and movement trajectories, are also subject 
      to this signature limit.

    p.center.huge-glow conclusion

  +slide_middle
    .hem-around-children
      p 1. There are two or more kinds of mindreading processes, one more automatic than another.
      p 2. One kind of mindreading process involves a minimal model of minds and actions while another involves a canonical model
      p 3. In the first three or four years of life, nonautomatic mindreading processes involve relatively crude models of minds and actions, models which do not enable belief tracking. What changes over development is typically just that the model underpinning nonautomatic mindreading becomes gradually more sophisticated and eventually comes to enable belief tracking.

    One problem for the dual process theory currently is that we need to be
    able to generate more predictions.

  .notes: :t
    As I said before, we need four ingredients to characterise a mindreading process:
    a model of minds and actions, a mechanism, a task- and response-analysis and 
    some signature limits.

    .notes: :t
      So far we have mainly focussed on deriving signature limits from models.
      But this is a fraught process: the more detailed we specify the model, the more
      arbitrary it is. [Compare Spelke’s principles of object perception.]
    .notes: :t
      A dual process theory of mindreading is in essence one that says there are multiple
      kinds of somewhat independent mindreading processes.  
      While this implies that the mindreading processes probably involve substantially different
      models of minds and actions, it doesn’t entail any very concrete committments.

      We therefore need to combine speculation about models with speculation about mechanims.s

    .notes: :t
      Given my attachment to the Crude Picture of the Mind, I'm attracted to a 
      simple but bold conjecture: \textbf{automatic mindreading is an extension of motor
      processes that underpin goal tracking}.
