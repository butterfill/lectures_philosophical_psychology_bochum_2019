  .notes: :t
    An immediate problem facing any advocate of a dual process theory is that 
    the most familiar such theories are burdened by what appear to be
    strong commitments which are not obviously needed to generate predictions.
  .notes: :t
    For instance, Spelke and Carey have proposed a distinction between core cognition and
    knowledge. Their distinction involves commitment to a dual process theory.
    But it also involves commitment to quite strong claims about innateness, phylogeny and
    representational format. These commitments appear unrelated to the anomalous pattern of
    development we aim to explain.
  .notes: :t
    To avoid theoretical commitments which seem inessential given our aim, it is perhaps useful
    to characterise the core commitment of any dual process theory in terms of a very simple
    causal model.
  //-
    Some researchers have proposed an alternative claim.
    Instead of treating implicit responses as simply providing more sensitive measures,
    Spelke and Carey have proposed a distinction between core cognition and knowledge.
    On this view, 






+slide({bkg:'dual_process_operationalized_10.jpg'})
  .notes: :t
    Here’s a depiction of the causal model I take to characterise any dual process theory.
  .notes: :t
    ‘response 1’ is a variable representing which response the subject will give.
    [Which values it takes will depend on what sort of response it is (e.g. a verbal
    response, proactive gaze, button press.)
    We can think of it as taking three values, one for correct belief tracking,
    one for fact tracking, and one for any other response.]
  .notes: :t
    ‘process 1’ and ‘process 2’ are variables which each represent whether a certain
    kind of mindreading process will occur and, if so, what it’s outcome is.
  .notes: :t
    And the arrows show that the probability that response 1 will have a certain value is
    influenced by the value of the variables process 1 and process 2 (and by other things
    not included in the model).
    So it should be possible to intervene on the value of ‘process 1’ in order to
    bring about a change in the value of ‘response 1’.
  .notes: :t
    [I’ve used thicker and thinner arrows informally to indicate stronger 
    and weaker dependence. Strictly speaking the width has no meaning and this model
    doesn’t specify exactly how the values of variables are related, only that they are.]

+slide_middle({bkg:'dual_process_operationalized_11.jpg'})
  .handout.img(data-src='img/dual_process_operationalized_11.neg.jpg')
  .notes: :t
    Of course, much the same is true for ‘response 2’ as well.  It’s just that
    the changing the values of other variables will have different effects on
    the values of ‘response 1’ and ‘response 2’.

    [Limit: this depiction ignores time, which is of course critical.]

      So what does a Dual Process Theory claim?
      The core claim is just this:
    .step1
      p.handout.notes.show Dual Process Theory (core part):
      p.handout.notes.show
        span Two (or more) processes for tracking Xs are distinct: 
        br
        span the conditions which influence whether they occur, 
        br 
        span and which outputs they generate, 
        br 
        span do not completely overlap.
    .notes: :t
      Of course, this is just the core part of a dual process theory, the part common to
      dual process theories of memory, of physical cognition, of reasoning, of mindreading, and of
      anything else.

  p.center operational characterisation
  .notes: :t
    Having given you a formal definition, let me also offer you an
    operationalization of a dual process theory of mindreading.
  .notes: :t
    Suppose you have two response types, R1 and R2, which can both indicate belief tracking
    (or, thinking more generally, perspective taking) under some conditions.
    Thinking operationally, what would it be for the two response types to reflect the
    operations of different systems?

  .notes: :t
    Suppose you have two response types, R1 and R2, which can both indicate belief tracking
    (or, thinking more generally, perspective taking) under some conditions.
    Thinking operationally, what would it be for the two response types to reflect the
    operations of different systems?
  .notes: :t
    First, the conditions under which one or another response type tracks beliefs should vary.  
  .notes: :t
    1.a E.g. changing the \textbf{instructions} should reduce the probability that responses
    of one type will track beliefs without much affecting the probability that responses
    of the other type will track belief.
  .notes: :t
    Evidence for this includes studies by Schenider et al
    
    
+slide({bkg:'dual_process_operationalized_2.jpg'})
  .notes: :t
    1.b Or, e.g., changing the \textbf{content of the belief} to be tracked from location to
    identity, say, should reduce the probability that responses of one type track beliefs
    without much affecting the probability that responses of the other type will track beliefs.
  .notes: :t
    Evidence for this includes studies by Low and his collaborators.
      
    
+slide({bkg:'dual_process_operationalized_3.jpg'})
  .notes: :t
    1a+b. And, ideally, it should be possible find different conditions that reduce the
    probability that different responses track beliefs.
  
    
+slide({bkg:'dual_process_operationalized_4.jpg'})
  .notes: :t
    Further, the probability that responses of these two types track beliefs should be
    differently affected by factors such as time pressure and cognitive load. (It isn’t
    important that either is entirely unaffected; what matters is just that the effects are
    different.)
  .notes: :t
    As far as I know we don’t yet have direct evidence for this, because few studies
    have compared what happens to two response types as factors like time pressure 
    or cognitive load are varies.
    There is, of course, some evidence that responses of some types are less susceptible
    to cognitive load than others (e.g. \citet{qureshi:2010_executive} on L1 VPT).

+slide_middle({bkg:'dual_process_operationalized_5.jpg'})
  .notes: :t
    So far I’ve been working with a simplifying assumption about the relation
    between types of response and kinds of process.
  .slide
    +blur('img.bkg', '5px')
    .first-attempt.center
      p Process 1 -> Response 1
      p Process 2 -> Response 2
    .notes: :t
      I’ve been assuming that responses of type R1 are dominated by one mindreading process
      whereas responses of type R2 are dominated by another mindreading process.
      But responses types and processes may not be so closely associated, of course.
  .slide
    +line-through('.first-attempt')
    .notes: :t
      This is because (a) any response is likely to be a consequence of multiple processes;
      and, (b), for some response types such as button selection or proactive gaze,
      changing factors like time pressure could change which mindreading process dominates
      responses of that type.
    .notes: :t
      In fact variability in the relation between a mindreading process and a response type
      is a potentially useful source of evidence in support of a dual process 
      theory of mindreading.
      Changes in the processes determining a response type can be detected where we have
      situations in which we know, or assume, the two processes yield different answers 
      (cf Todd et al).
      For example ...
    
+slide({bkg:'dual_process_operationalized_6.jpg'})
  .notes: :t
    To illustrate, take the case where we instruct subjects to track the location
    of a ball. 
    Subjects are asked to press a button to indicate whether a ball is present or absent.
    We know that button selection will not track beliefs when subjects are not 
    under time pressure.
    But what happens if we increase time pressure.

+slide({bkg:'dual_process_operationalized_7.jpg'})
  .notes: :t
    It is possible that increasing time pressure will very slightly, but perhaps
    measurably increase the probability that button presses 
    are dominated by a different mindreading process, one that is less sensitive to
    instructions.  In that case, we would expect to observe slightly more 
    belief tracking in the responses as time pressure is increased.
  .notes: :t
    \citet{todd:2016_dissociating} have recently demonstrated this type of effect
    for L1-VPT; as far as I know, it has not yet been demonstrated for belief tracking.


+slide({bkg:'dual_process_operationalized_10.jpg'})
  .notes: :t
    So here’s the causal model I take to underlie a dual process theory.
  .notes: :t
    ‘response 1’ is a variable representing which response the subject will give.
    [Which values it takes will depend on what sort of response it is (e.g. a verbal
    response, proactive gaze, button press.)
    We can think of it as taking three values, one for correct belief tracking,
    one for fact tracking, and one for any other response.]
  .notes: :t
    ‘process 1’ and ‘process 2’ are variables which each represent whether a certain
    kind of mindreading process will occur and, if so, what it’s outcome is.
  .notes: :t
    And the arrows show that the probability that response 1 will have a certain value is
    influenced by the value of the variables process 1 and process 2 (and by other things
    not included in the model).
    So it should be possible to intervene on the value of ‘process 1’ in order to
    bring about a change in the value of ‘response 1’.
  .notes: :t
    [I’ve used thicker and thinner arrows informally to indicate stronger 
    and weaker dependence. Strictly speaking the width has no meaning and this model
    doesn’t specify exactly how the values of variables are related, only that they are.]

+slide({bkg:'dual_process_operationalized_11.jpg'})
  .handout.img(data-src='img/dual_process_operationalized_11.neg.jpg')
  .notes: :t
    Of course, much the same is true for ‘response 2’ as well.  It’s just that
    the changing the values of other variables will have different effects on
    the values of ‘response 1’ and ‘response 2’.
  .notes: :t
    [Limit: this depiction ignores time, which is of course critical.]
    
  .slide
    +blur('img.bkg')
    .notes: :t
      But for many practical purposes, we can ignore the full complexity of this model.
      For much of the time we can ignore the fact that changing factors like time pressure may
      alter how response types relate to mindreading processes.
      So let me get back to the basic, crude picture.

+slide({bkg:'dual_process_operationalized_5.jpg'})
  .notes: :t
    On the crude picture, responses of different types, R1 and R2, are dominated by
    different kinds of mindreading process.
    This is manifest in that 
  .notes: :t
    (1) the conditions under which one or another response type tracks beliefs vary;
  .notes: :t
    and
  .notes: :t
    (2) the probability that responses of these two types track beliefs should be differently
    affected by factors such as time pressure and cognitive load.
  .notes: :t
    Note that there is nothing peculiar to the case of mindreading here.
    Much the same ideas apply to dual process theories of memory, or 
    reasoning or physical cognition.

  +slide_middle
    p.center development?
    .notes: :t
      So far I haven’t said anything about development at all.
      The bare idea of a dual process theory doesn’t have developmental committments.
      But one key attraction of a dual process theory is that it can make sense of 
      otherwise anomalous patterns in development ...

  +slide_middle({bkg:'dual_process_operationalized_12.jpg'})
    .notes: :t
      In particular, a dual process theory has the power to explain why
      comparing two types of response may yield interactions between age and performance.
    .notes: :t
      Much developmental research indicates that there are indeed striking
      age-performance interactions.
      This is a huge problem.
      No current attempt to explain these interactions without a dual process theory of
      mindreading is even consistent with the available evidence. 
      This motivates considering the possibility that a dual
      process theory of mindreading is correct.

    So far I’ve been characterising a dual process theory of mindreading which, like 
    dual process theories of memory and reasoning, focusses on adults.

    Signature limits are important in two ways.
    First, they generate predictions.
    And second, they allow us to test hypotheses linking particular kinds of mindreading
    process across developmental time.

      There is  some evidence that this prediction is correct.
      Jason Low and his collegaues set out to test it.
      They have now published three 
      different papers showing such limits; and Hannes Rakoczy and others 
      have more work in progress on this.
      Collapsing several experiements using different approaches,
      the basic pattern of their findings is this ...
    .notes: :t
      Take non-automatic responses first; in this case, communicative responses.
      When you do a false-belief-identity task, you see the pattern you also
      find for false-belief-locations tasks.
      But things look different when you measure non-automatic responses ...
    .notes: :t()
      The non-automatic responses all show the signature limit of minimal
      models of the mental.
      This is evidence for the hypothesis that 
      Some automatic belief-tracking systems rely on minimal models of the mental.
    .notes: :t()
      I also hear that quite a few scientists have pilot data that speaks
      against this signature limit.
    .notes: :t()
      One particular task for future research will be to examine whether other
      automatic responses to scenarios involving false beliefs about identity,
      such as response times and movement trajectories, are also subject 
      to this signature limit.

    p.center.huge-glow conclusion

  +slide_middle
    .hem-around-children
      p 1. There are two or more kinds of mindreading processes, one more automatic than another.
      p 2. One kind of mindreading process involves a minimal model of minds and actions while another involves a canonical model
      p 3. In the first three or four years of life, nonautomatic mindreading processes involve relatively crude models of minds and actions, models which do not enable belief tracking. What changes over development is typically just that the model underpinning nonautomatic mindreading becomes gradually more sophisticated and eventually comes to enable belief tracking.

    conditions: (A) FB-identity, (B) FB-location, (C) TB-identity, and (D) TB-location. The course
    was divided into 4 stages: (1) swerving, (2) advancing, (3) reaching, and (4) ultimately handing
    over the actual or non-actual bag (dotted lines represent thresholds for each stage). In
    Experiment 2, we examined how stalling of motor representations, by temporarily tying individual
    observers’ hands (E), affected the course of their (N = 24) helping action in the FB-location
    condition (F).

    Can a dual process theory of mindreading accommodate this objection?
  .notes: :t
    This question came up in discussion with Jason Low 
    and together with Chris Maymon we found a way to answer it.
    Our conjecture was that athough automatic mindreading processes 
    are unlikely to feed into deliberative reasoning about what to do,
    they could affect motor actions and so initiate action in the right direction.
  .notes: :t
    To test this conjecture, we developed a simple helping paradigm.

    Maymon et al divided participants’ movements into four stages:
    swerving (stage-1), advancing (stage-2) towards the actual or non-actual bag, 
    reaching (stage-3) for the bag, and ultimately handing over (stage-4) the actual or
    non-actual bag.

    The first stage of movement shows just the pattern that first fixation did,
    and indeed in FB-LOC, first fixation and swerve are correlated.

      So far we have mainly focussed on deriving signature limits from models.

      arbitrary it is. [Compare Spelke’s principles of object perception.]
    .notes: :t
      A dual process theory of mindreading is in essence one that says there are multiple
      kinds of somewhat independent mindreading processes.  
      While this implies that the mindreading processes probably involve substantially different
      models of minds and actions, it doesn’t entail any very concrete committments.
