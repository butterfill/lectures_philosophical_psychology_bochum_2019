    The question was how we can get beyond intuition in understanding the verbal reports.
  p How to get beyond intuition?
  p The launching effect: detecting a 50ms difference in the delay between two movements.
  .notes: :t
    Part of the answer is this.  We don't worry about the content of the verbal reports.
    We just focus on the fact that their content changes depending on a tiny, 50 millisecond
    difference in the delay between two movements.
    Call this \emph{launching effect}.
  .notes: :t
    This doesn't tell us what people are detecting.
    But it does tell us that the effect is not merely confabulation or making it up.
    So we have taken a tiny step beyond intuition.  But we also have to answer two questions.

    .notes: :t
      But before we get to that, what is this about causal interactions?
      It's reasonably obvious that object indexes require segmentation (otherwise how would they
      attach to *objects*), and the evidence that they can survive occlusion is relatively easy to
      understand.  But the point that having object indexes involves tracking causal interactions
      is less straightforward.  So let's consider that ...
  
+slide({bkg:'slide_causal_london_52.jpg'})
  .notes: :t
    Object indexes are linked to causation.
    In order to track objects, a perceptual system has to be sensitive to be causal interactions
  .notes: :t
    Why is this true?
    Because when you have a causal interaction, there's a conflict between principles of object 
    perception e.g. distinct surfaces=>two objects, vs good continuity of motion=>one object
    The perceptual system needs to know when conflicts should be reconciled and when they should 
    be written off.
    We get perceptual effects of causal interactions when there are conflicts among cues of object 
    identity.
  .notes: :t
    This is a point Michotte made.  He found that launching occurs when there is a conflict between 
    cues to object identity: good continuity of movement suggests a single object whereas the 
    existence of two distinct surfaces indicates two objects.
  .notes: :t
    It is plausible that other types of causal interaction also involve conflicts between cues 
    to object identity.

    Krushke and Fragassi (1996) have shown that the object-specific preview effect vanishes 
    in launching but not in various spatio-temporally similar sequences.  Since the object-specific 
    preview effect is regarded as diagnostic of feature binding, this is evidence that in launching 
    sequences, features of the second object (such as motion) remain bound to the first object for 
    a short time after the second object starts to move.

    Schlottmann and Shanks (1992, Experiment 2) ... The point of this
    experiment was to distinguish between cues to causality provided by
    perceptual features within a display (launching vs. delay) and by
    statistical contingencies (between Object A moving and Object B moving) as
    observed across trials. If Michotte’s hypothesis is correct, statistical
    contingencies should not affect perceptual judgments of whether a
    launching has occurred. Conversely, perceptual features should not affect
    judgments of whether A’s movement is statistically necessary for B’s
    movement.  ... The results of the study were clear cut ...: Launching versus delay
    affected ratings of how convincing the collisions looked but not ratings of
    necessity. However, the presence of a predictive statistical relation
    affected ratings of necessity but not ratings of convincingness. These
    results are consistent with Michotte’s hypothesis: Statistical
    contingencies over trials do not affect the cause detector on the right of
    Figure 3A, which is sensitive only to purely spatio-temporal properties of
    the individual displays.

    impact of Object A, where was no impact of the predictive relationship on subjects’ ratings of
    perceived causality. In other experiments asking subjects to make causal judgements, however, such
    alternative predictive signals are known to reduce subjects’ ratings dramatically (Shanks, 1986).’

    launching sequence from the others only if their right hemisphere processed
    the event. By contrast, the same patients were able to solve a causal

    The impression of launching is judgement-independent.
    So it can't be a consequence of thinking about the interaction.
    Still, it might be a consequence of perceiving objects in certain relations to each other.
    However a key finding shows that this is wrong.
    Surprisingly, we don't first perceive objects and then get the launching effect;
    rather, the launching effect is tied up with perceptual process of identifying objects' surfaces.

            overlaps the second's position before it moves.  When this event is shown is isolation 
            almost all subjects see it as a single object changing colour.  But when the event is 
            shown with an 
            unambiguous launching effect nearby, almost all subjects now see the 'overlap' event as 
            a launching.
            Causal capture means that we can show subjects a sequence with complete overlap and 
            still have the report a causal effect.

      ‘This possibility, though, is not one that advocates of Michotte’s
      hypothesis have taken up. The favored view is one in which separate
      modules are responsible for descriptions of objects and of their
      mechanical interactions, with central mechanisms then resolving potential
      conflicts between them. 
      For example, Leslie (1988) argues that perceptual
      modules do not by themselves settle inconsistencies between the spatial
      positions of objects and their causal interactions. In certain 
      illusions, adults tend to perceive solid objects passing through each other
      (Leslie cites the Pulfrich double-pendulum illusion; see Wilson &
      Robinson, 1986). Thus, the module for object tracking doesn’t prohibit
      interpretations of physical events that are causally impossible. Of
      course, people realize that such events cannot really be taking place and
      are surprised when they perceive them, but that is because they have
      principles stored in long-term memory—for example, the principle that two
      solid objects cannot be in the same place at the same time—that classify
      these events as illusions or anomalies. Leslie’s argument suggests
      that people individuate objects and calculate their causal relations by
      means of separate mechanisms; thus, we can’t count on causal constraints
      being part of the object-tracking module. If Leslie is right, there is
      reason to question Butterfill’s (2009) conjecture that ‘object
      perception and causal perception are one and the same process’’ (p.
      421).’
    .notes: :t
      Response: it was too simple to say that 
      ‘object perception and causal perception are one and the same process’ or to
      talk about ‘object perception and physical reasoning’ because object perception 
      is a complicated thing with many aspects.
      What Carey and Spelke (and following them, Butterfill) should have said is that
      there is a system of object indexes which assigns indexes in ways that reflects
      physical constraints such as solidity on objects’ motions, and this is what gives
      rise to the launching effect.

      .notes: :t
        How is this consistent with the laws of mechanics—surely no pause can be tolerated? 
        Ingeniously, Michotte compares launching with the movement of a single object. The single 
        object moves half way across a screen then pauses before continuing to move. Michotte found 
        that the longest pause between the two movements consistent with subjects experiencing them 
        as a single movement is around 80ms, exactly the longest pause consistent with experiences 
        characteristic of launching \citep[pp.\ 91--8, 124]{Michotte:1946nz}. Accordingly, the 
        experience characteristic of launching appears to require that the two movements be 
        experienced as uninterrupted—--this is why they can be separated by a pause of up to but 
        no longer than 80ms.

  p.notes.ctd.show Can humans perceive causal interactions?

    Now I think we have achieved an answer:

  .notes: :t
    The perceptual system responsible for identifying objects must also concern itself with certain 
    kinds of causal interaction in order to reconcile conflicting cues to object identity. 
  .notes: :t
    In slightly more detail: one function of our perceptual systems is to identify and track 
    objects; this is done by means of various cues; sometimes the visual system is faced with 
    conflicting cues to object identity which need to be resolved in order to arrive at a 
    satisfactory interpretation; when certain types of causal interaction occur there is a 
    conflict among cues to object identity; these conflicts must be treated differently from other 
    conflicts because they do not indicate failures of object identification and so do not  
    require resolution or further perceptual processing. 
    So object perception depends on sensitivity to certain types of causal interaction and this is 
    why the launching effect occurs.
  .notes: :t
    This is unexpected insofar as perception is often supposed to be limited to features of the 
    world less abstract that causal interactions.  Indeed, the notion that perceptual processes
    represent three-dimensional objects rather than mere surfaces was at one time controversial.
    The research we have reviewed shows that perceptual processes represent not only 
    three-dimensional but properly physical objects, that is, objects capable of causally
    interacting with each other.
