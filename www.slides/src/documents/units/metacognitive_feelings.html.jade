  .notes: :t
    What is a metacognitive feeling?  I think it’s a sensation.
    To illustrate, 
  .notes: :t
    contrast two sensory encounters with this wire. In the first you visually 
    experience the wire as having a certain shape. In the second you receive an 
    electric shock from the wire without seeing or touching it.%
    \footnote{This illustration is borrowed from Campbell (2002: 133–4); I use it to support a claim weaker than his.}
    The first sensory encounter involves perceptual experience as of a property of
    the wire whereas, intuitively, the second does not. 
    I take this intuition to be correct.%
    \footnote{
    Notice that the intuition is not that the shock involves no 
    perceptual experience at all, only that the shock does not involve 
    perceptual experience as of any property of the wire. Notice also that the 
    intuition concerns what a perceptual experience is as of, and not directly 
    what is represented in perception. The relation between these two is 
    arguably not straightforward (compare, e.g., \citet[p.~28]{Shoemaker:1994el} or 
    \citet[pp.~50--2]{Chalmers:2006xq} on distinguishing representational from 
    phenomenal content).
    }
  .notes: :t
    The intuition is potentially revealing because the electric shock involves 
    rich phenomenology, and its particular phenomenal character depends in part 
    on properties of its cause (changes in the strength of the electric current 
    would have resulted in an encounter with different phenomenal character). 
    So there are sensory encounters which, despite having phenomenal characters 
    that depend in part on which properties are encountered, are not perceptual 
    experiences as of those properties.

    All three examples (the feelings of magic, of electricity and of 
    familiarity) show that:

  .notes: :t
    To illustrate, having a feeling of familiarity is not a matter of standing 
    in any
    intentional relation to the property of familiarity, but it is something
    that we can interpret as informative about famility.
  .slide
    +hide('.there')
    +show('.pe')
    .notes: :t
      Metacognitive feelings are these aspects of experience.
    .notes: :t
      Why accept this?  You cannot perceive familiarity or agency any more than you can 
      perceive electricity.
      Perceptual processes do not reach far back into your past, nor are they concerned
      with questions about whether you are the agent of an action.
      So to think that metacognitive feelings intentionally relate you to facts about
      familiarity or agency requires postulating a novel kind of sensory process, some kind
      of inner or bodily sense.
      While justification for postulating a novel inner sense may ultimately be discovered, I don’t
      think there is currently anything to justify this.
    .notes: :t
      [EITHER]
      To see why we are not justified in postulating a novel inner sense, it is worth recalling
      Reid’s theory of sensations.
      
      [OR] But this is right, why do metacognitive feelings invite judgements? Why does the
      feeling of familiarity even so much as nudge you to judge that the face photographed
      here is familiar to you?  (This is roughly \citet{dokic:2012_seeds}’s question.)

    [Key point to stress there is just that
    metacognitive feelings are not intentional states, they are not representations,
    they have no content. [Or if they do have content, it’s not related to
    the things we take them to be associated with, like familiarity or electricity.] 
    They are blank sensations. Compare the sensation associated
    with an electrical shock. It’s not a perception of electricity.]

  .notes: :t
    metacognitive feelings can be thought of as sensations in approximately
    Reid’s sense.%
    \footnote{
    \citet{Reid:1785cj,Reid:1785nz}.
    Even if you don’t believe that there are sensations in Reid’s sense,
    thinking of metacognitive feelings as if they were sensations will
    serve to illustrate their characteristic features.
    The main points that follow are consistent with several different ways of
    thinking about metacognitive feelings.
    For instance, you might take the view that 
    what I am calling metacognitive feelings are
    perceptual experiences of the body or of bodily reactions,
    or that they involve some kind of cognitive phenomenology.
    The essential claim is just that the metacognitive feelings associated with
    the operations of object indexes are not constituted by states which involve
    intentional relations to any of the things which are assigned an object index.

      Metacognitive feelings are signs:
      they can lead to beliefs via associations or further beliefs
      (\citealp[Essay~II, Chap.~16, p.~228]{Reid:1785cj};

      \citealp[Chap.~VI sect.~III, pp.~164–5]{Reid:1785nz}).
      Let me explain.
    .notes: :t
      As a scientist, you can pick out the feeling of familiarity as that
      metacognitive feeling which is normally caused by the degree to which
      certain processes are fluent.
      But as the subject of who has that metacognitive feeling, you do not 
      necessarily know what its typical causes are.
      This is something you have to work out in whatever ways you work out
      the causes of any other type of event.
      

    .notes: :t
      (Contrast metacognitive feelings with perceptual experiences.
      Having 
      a perceptual experience of, say, a wire’s shape, involves standing
      in an intentional relation to the wire’s shape; and the phenomenal
      character of this perceptual experience is specified by this 
      intentional relation.%
      \footnote{
      Compare \citet[p.~380]{Martin:2002yx}:
      ‘I attend to what it is like for me to inspect the lavender bush through 
      perceptually attending to the bush itself.’ 
      And \citet[p.~211]{byrne:2001_intentionalism}
      ‘subject can only discover the phenomenal character of her experience by 
      attending to the world ... as her experience represents it.’
      }
      Such perceptual experiences are often held to reveal the wire’s shape to the 
      subject and so lead directly to beliefs.%
      \footnote{
      Compare \citet[p.~222]{Johnston:1992zb}:
      ‘[j]ustified belief … is available simply on the basis of visual perception’;
      \citet[p.~143–4]{Tye:1995oa}:
      ‘Phenomenal character “stands ready … to make a direct impact on beliefs’;
      and
      \citet[p.~291]{Smith:2001iz}:
      ‘[p]erceptual experiences are … intrinsically … belief-inducing.’
      })
    .notes: :t
      (By contrast, having a metacognitive feeling concerning familiarity or an
      physical object’s path does not involve standing in any intentional relation
      to these things.
      The metacognitive feeling is individuated by its normal causes, rather 
      than by any intentional relation.
      And a metacognitive feeling leads to belief, if at all, only indirectly.
      For learning is required in order for the subject to come to a view on
      what tends to cause the metacognitive feeling.)

    .notes: :t
      metacognitive feelings have been quite widely neglected in philosophy and
      developmental psychology.
      They are a means by which cognitive processes enable perceivers to 
      acquire dispositions to form beliefs about objects’ properties which are 
      reliably true.    
      metacognitive feelings provide a low-cost but efficient bridge between 
      non-conscious cognitive processes and conscious reasoning.

        .notes \section{Development Is Rediscovery}
        .notes: :t
          This guess gives rise to a further question (which I want to articulate
          but won’t attempt to answer).
          In asking how the operations of object indexes might give rise to
          patterns in looking duration, we have been concerned with what happens a 
          short interval of time.
          But the guess about metacognitive feelings raises a question
          about the course of development in the first months or years of life.
          Let me explain.
      
        .slide
          +invert('.id-core-knowledge')
          +show('.mom')
          .notes: :t
            In the beginning Spelke and others conjectured that infants’ 
            abilities to track briefly occluded objects were a consequence of their
            having core knowledge for objects.
            This conjecture is related to the later hypothesis about object indexes.
            The idea is that we can further specify the mechanisms that realise
            infants’ core knowledge of physical objects by identifying it with
            two things: a system of object indexes and a system capable of representing
            physical objects motorically.
          .notes: :t
            So core knowledge of objects is not one thing but three:
            it is realised by (i) a system of object indexes; (ii) associated
            metacognitive feelings and (iii) a capacity
            to represent affordances motorically.
        .slide
          +uninvert('.id-core-knowledge')
          .notes: :t
            There was always a question about how infants’ core knowledge about
            objects might explain the emergence of knowledge knowledge 
            (that is, knowledge proper) about objects.
            Now this question becomes, What is the role of a system of object
            indexes in the emergence in development of knowledge of physical 
            objects?
            In short, How do you get from object indexes to knowledge?
          .notes: :t
            Answers to these questions typically rely on 
            \emph{The Assumption of Representational Connections}: the transition involves
            operations on the contents of core knowledge states, which transform them into
            (components of) the contents of knowledge states.
          .notes: :t
            This Assumption is required by almost any current account
            of the developmental emergence of knowledge.
            It is required, for example, by
            Spelke’s suggestion that mature understanding of objects, number, 
            and mind derives from core knowledge by virtue of core knowledge 
            representations being assembled \citep{Spelke:2000nf}; 
            claims by Leslie and others 
            that modules provide conceptual identifications of their inputs 
            \citep{Leslie:1988ct}; 
            Karmiloff-Smith’s representational re-description 
            \citep{Karmiloff-Smith:1992lv}; 
            and Mandler’s claim 
            that ‘the earliest conceptual functioning consists of a redescription 
            of perceptual structure’ \citep{Mandler:1992vn}.  
          .notes: :t
            But the Assumption of Representational Connections requires, of course, that core
            knowledge provides a conceptual identification of objects and some of their
            properties such as location or size, or at least that it involves standing in some
            kind of intentional relation to these things.

        .slide
          +unblur('.left-half')
          .notes: :t
            [Key point is that since  metacognitive feelings don’t have [relevant] content,
            direct representational connections between core knowledge and knowledge
            proper are impossible.]
          .notes: :t
            But recall the guess about metacognitive feelings linking object 
            indexes to patterns of looking duration.
            If this guess is right, then it is not true that
            core knowledge provides a conceptual identification of objects.
            And it is not true that having core knowledge involves standing in any
            kind of intentional relation to objects and their properties.
            This means that we must reject 
            Assumption of Representational Connections.
            And rejecting this Assumption makes the question about development particularly
            difficult to answer.
          .notes: :t
            It means that rather than assembing or redescribing representations,
            development must be a process of rediscovery.
          .notes: :t
            The step from metacognitive feelings to knowledge is like the step 
            from feeling electric shocks to understanding electricity.
            So coming to know simple facts about particular physical 
            objects may begin with object indexes and the 
            metacognitive feelings these give rise to, but it does not end there.
            Interpreting the metacognitive feelings may involve interacting with 
            objects, learning to use tools, and perhaps interacting with others 
            and objects simultaneously.
          .notes: :t
            Coming to know facts about physical objects is a matter of 
            rediscovering things already implicit in a system of object indexes.
          .notes: :t
            Some might object that development can’t require such rediscovery 
            because it would be hopelessly inefficient to require things already 
            encoded to be learnt anew.
            But rediscovery is an elegant solution to a practical problem.
            If you are building a survival system you want quick and dirty 
            heuristics that are good enough to keep it alive: you don’t 
            necessarily care about the truth.
            If, by contrast, you are building a thinker, you want her to be 
            able to think things that are true irrespective of their survival value.  
            This cuts two ways.
            On the one hand, you want the thinker’s thoughts not to be 
            constrained by heuristics that ensure her survival.
            On the other hand, in allowing the thinker freedom to pursue the 
            truth there is an excellent chance she will end up profoundly 
            mistaken %(Malebranche?) 
            or deeply confused %(Hegel?) 
            about the nature of physical objects.
            So you don’t want thought contaminated by survival heuristics and you 
            don’t want survival heuristics contaminated by thought.  Or, even if 
            some contamination is inevitable, you want to limit it.
            %So you want inferential isolation.
            This combination is beautifully achieved by giving your thinker a 
            system or some systems for tracking objects and their interactions 
            which appear early in development, and also a mind which allows her 
            to acquire knowledge of physical objects gradually over months or 
            years, taking advantage of interactions with objects as well as 
            social interactions about objects—providing, of course, that the 
            two are not directly connected but rather linked only very loosely, 
            via metacognitive feelings.
          .notes: :t
            Of course, if 
            the Assumption of Representational Connectedness is wrong and
            development is rediscovery,
            then core knowledge can only play a relatively modest role in explaining
            the developmental acquisition of knowledge.
            Instead, simple froms of social interaction, perhaps including 
            referential communication or even communication by language 
            will play a key role in the developmental emergence of knowledge of 
            simple facts about physical objects.
            And of course they can only do this if abilities for social interactions
            including communication do not already presuppose such knowledge.
          .notes: :t
            But this is a topic for further inquiry.
            For now, I mainly want to sugggest that we must either reject my claim
            that core knowledge influences its subject only through modifications 
            of the body, of behaviour and attention and of phenomenology
            or else face up to the challenge of explaining how development
            could be a process, not of recycling representations already
            available in the very first months of life, but of rediscovery.
