  What is the relation between a purposive action and the outcome or outcomes to which it is directed?
  One way of answering this question appeals to intentions.
  On any standard view, an intention
  represents an outcome, causes an action, and does so in a way that would normally facilitate
  the outcome’s occurrence.

    Which events are actions?
    In philosophy, answering this question would typically answered by appeal to intention 
    or practical reasoning.

    Let me suggest one reason why this view seems tempting ...

    You tilt the bottle thereby pouring prosecco all over Zac's trousers.
    You might say, the goal of my actions was not to soak Zac's trousers but to 
    fill his glass.

      As this illustrates, 
      some actions involving are purposive in the sense that 
  .slide
    +show('.outcome')
    .notes: :t
      among all their actual and possible consequences, 
  .slide
    +show('.outcome.block .block-glow')
    .notes: :t
      there are outcomes to which they are directed
    .notes: :t
      In such cases we can say that the actions are clearly purposive.
  .slide
    +show('.question')
    .notes: :t
      Concerning any such actions, we can ask
      What is the relation between a purposive action and the outcome or outcomes to which it is directed?
  .slide
    +blur('img.bkg')
    +show('.explain-collective-directedness')
    .notes: :t
      The standard answer to this question involves intention.
  .slide
    +show('.represents')
    .notes: :t
      An intention (1) specifies an outcome, 
  .slide
    +show('.coordinates')
    .notes: :t
      (2) coordinates the one or several activities which comprise the action; 
    .notes: :t
      and (3) coordinate these activities in a way that would normally facilitate the outcome’s occurrence.
    .notes: :t
      What binds particular component actions together into larger purposive actions?  
      It is the fact that these actions are all parts of plans involving a single intention.
      What singles out an actual or possible outcome as one to which the component 
      actions are collectively directed?  It is the fact that this outcome is 
      represented by the intention.
    .notes: :t
      So the intention is what binds component actions together into purposive actions and 
      links the action taken as a whole to the outcomes to which they are directed.
  //- .slide
  //-   +show('.iasmr')
  //-   .notes: :t
  //-     But is intention the only thing that can link actions to outcomes?
  //-     I will suggest that motor representations can likewise perform this role.

    Such views tend to be neutral on how 
    the attitudes and processes ultimately connect to bodily movements; 
    that is considered to be merely an implementation detail ...
  .notes: :t
    They are neutral in this sense: the views do not depend in any way on facts about that 
    distinguish one kind of body from another, or on facts about how the body’s movements 
    are ultimately controlled ...

    In cognitive science ... little to say about actions whose purposes
    involve things the motor system doesn’t care about---your motor system
    doesn’t care whether the plane you are stepping is headed for Milan or
    for Rome, but this sort of difference can affect whether your actions succeed or fail.

  //-     But we want to argue that these two views are components of a single, larger story about action.
  //-     Although intention and motor representation can usefully be studied in isolation
