    Suppose, as argued, it is untrue that humans visually experience red or any
    other categorical colour properties.
    Why have so many philosophers have assumed the opposite, and done so without argument?
  .handout: :t
    Some time after learning to use a colour term like ‘red’
    somewhat accurately, humans become faster and more accurate at
    distinguishing things which differ in whether they have the property
    denoted by that colour term (faster: \citealp{Bornstein:1984cb}; more
    accurate: \citealp[p.\ 22--7]{Roberson:1999rk}; not usually immediately:
    \citealp{Franklin:2005hp}). In fact, methods highly similar to those which
    indicate the absence of appearances do reveal that these properties affect
    speed and accuracy of discrimination (\citealp{witzel:2014_categorical}).
    As discrimination of these colour properties depends on pre-attentive
    processes which are automatic in some of the senses that perceptual
    processes are \citep{Daoutis:2006ij,clifford_color_2010}, the abilities to
    discriminate may intuitively give rise to the impression that properties
    like \emph{red} affect how things appear.

    As I said, I want to have a go at rejecting the fifth premise without rejecting the first premise.
  .notes For an example of a category effect which is automatic, I need to introduce you to the odd-ball paradigm.
  .notes In the odd-ball paradigm, you see a series of things that are all the same; and then, unpredictably, you see something different.
  .notes We can use sensitivity to odd-balls to measure the difference between the two blues and the blue-green pair.
  .notes This is useful because odd-ball effects can be detected very early in visual processessing, before attention kicks in.
  .notes They allow us to probe automatic processes.

    Now suppose we play you an odd ball sequence.
    We want to know whether an automatic process picks up on the difference.
    And we want to know whether the automatic process picks up on the difference always or only when a category change is involved.
    To do this we need to measure an event-related potential called vMMN (which is short for visual mismatch negativity).

    So let me show you a task that uses this odd-ball effect
    Fixate on this cross.
    And when you see the rectangle, press the space bar with both index fingers.
    That's it.
    Except that you also see a block of colour on every trial.
    You're instructed to ignore this block of colour.
    And generally that's easy because it's always the same colour.
    But just occasionally it's a different colour.
    In one condition, the usual and odd-ball colours are the blues.
    And in the other condition, the usual and odd-ball colours are cross-category, from blue-green.
    We're interested in whether there's a sign that your brain has detected the change when the odd ball colour occurs.
  .notes: :t
    Put roughly, the results show that there is signal of pre-attentive change detection at around 100-200 milliseconds in the left visual field.

  .notes This is another way of presenting the same finding.
  .notes The vMMN is a DRN, but not all DRNs are vMMNs (see the paper).
  .notes: :t
    Since this study \citep{clifford_color_2010}, \citet{he:2014_color} have challenged 
    the results arguing that there is no vMMN when you control for irregularities in
    colour spaces using JNDs. However \citet{zhong:2015_shortterm} find a vMMN for 
    newly trained categorical colour properties (which \citep{clifford:2012_neural}) didn’t.
