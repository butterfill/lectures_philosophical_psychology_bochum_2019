    Stokes makes this observation in passing.  I want to show 
    that what Stokes finds so suprising is true, or would be if it were true that 
    red things differ in visual appearance from non-red things.

      Stokes has formulated things badly here.
      The important thing isn’t the particular word I use, ‘red’ vs, say, ‘rot’,
      ‘rosso’ or ‘rose’.
      Rather it’s that I have a label for the perceived object which I also 
      use for all the things that have the property red.

    Argument:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Red things differ in visual appearance from non-red things.
    \item The capacity to detect the difference in visual appearance between
    red and non-red things is, or depends on, the capacity to visually
    discriminate red and non-red things.
    \item The capacity to visually discriminate red and non-red things depends
    on the capacity to label the red things (for example, using ‘red’).
    \end{enumerate}
    Therefore:
    \begin{enumerate}[resume]
    \item I have a perceptual experience as of red span.italic
    because span I call the perceived object ‘red’.
    \end{enumerate}

      It turns out that
      the ability to discriminate properties denoted by particular colour terms like
      ‘red’ depends not only on having learned to use those very terms accurately in
      the past \citep{Ozgen:2002yk,Winawer:2007im,zhou:2010_newly} but also on being
      able to activate some component of the ability to apply the colour term at the
      time a stimulus is presented
      \citep{Roberson:2000ge,Pilling:2003bi,Wiggett:2008xt}. % page refs: (Roberson,
      Davies and Davidoff 2000: 985; Pilling, Wiggett, et al. 2003: 549-50; Wiggett
      and Davies 2008) 
      
      Someone who accepts that there are visual experiences as of
      \emph{red} must either suppose that these experiences are only indirectly
      related to abilities to discriminate or else accept the surprising idea that
      such visual experiences are a consequence of covert labelling. This dilemma can
      be avoided by rejecting the subject-determining platitude and with it the
      existence in humans of visual experiences as of \emph{red}.
