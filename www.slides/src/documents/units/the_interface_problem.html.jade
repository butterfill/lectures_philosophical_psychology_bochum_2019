description: """
  For a single action, which outcomes it is directed to may be multiply
  determined by an intention and, seemingly independently, by a motor
  representation. Unless such intentions and motor representations are to pull
  an agent in incompatible directions, which would typically impair action
  execution, there are requirements concerning how the outcomes they represent
  must be related to each other. This is the interface problem: explain how any
  such requirements could be non-accidentally met.

  The interface problem: explain how intentions and motor representations, with their distinct
  representational formats, are related in such a way that, in at least some cases, the outcomes they
  specify non-accidentally match.
  
.handout: :t
  ‘both mundane cases of action slips and pathological conditions, such as apraxia or anarchic hand
  syndrome (AHS), illustrate the existence of an interface problem’ 
  \citep[p.~7]{mylopoulos:2016_intentions}.
  
.handout: :t
  Two collections of outcomes, A and B, \emph{match} in a particular context just if, in that context,
  either the occurrence of the A-outcomes would normally constitute or cause, at least partially, the
  occurrence of the B-outcomes or vice versa. To illustrate, one way of matching is for the B-outcomes
  to be the A-outcomes. Another way of matching is for the B-outcomes to stand to the A-outcomes as
  elements of a more detailed plan stand to those of a less detailed one.

    Imagine that you are strapped to a spinning wheel facing near certain death as it plunges you into
    freezing water. To your right you can see a lever and to your left there is a button. In deciding
    that pulling the lever offers you a better chance of survival than pushing the button, you form an
    intention to pull the lever, hoping that this will stop the wheel. If things go well, and if
    intentions are not mere epiphenomena, this intention will result in your reaching for, grasping and
    pulling the lever. These actions---reaching, grasping and pulling---may be directed to specific
    outcomes in virtue of motor representations which guide their execution. It shouldn't be an accident
    that, in your situation, you both intend to pull a lever and you end up with motor representations
    of reaching for, grasping and pulling that very lever, so that the outcomes specified by your
    intention match those specified by motor representations. If this match between outcomes variously
    specified by intentions and by motor representations is not to be accidental, what could explain it?

      As we have just seen, motor representations specify goals.
    p.slide.em-above Intentions specify goals.
      .notes: :t
        And of course, so do intentions.
    p.slide.em-above Some actions involve both intention and motor representation.
      .notes: :t
        Further, many actions involve both intention and motor representation.
        When, for example, you form an intention to turn the lights out, the goal
        of flipping the light switch may be represented motorically in you.
      .notes: :t
        The nonaccidental success of our actions therefore depends on the outcomes
        specified by our intentions and motor representations matching.

      either the occurrence of A would normally constitute or cause, at least 
      partially, the occurrence of B or vice versa. 
    .notes: :t
      But how should they match?
      I think they should match in this sense:
      the occurrence of the outcome specified by the motor representation would 
      would normally constitute or cause, at least 
      partially, the occurrence of the outcome specified by the intention.

      Now we have to ask, How are nonaccidental matches possible?
      If you asked a similar question about desire and intention, the answer would be 
      straightforward: desire and intention are integrated in practical reasoning, so it 
      is no surprise that what you intend sometimes nonaccidentally conforms to what you intend.
      But we cannot give the same sort of answer in the case of motor representations and 
      intentions because ...

    +show('.inf-int')
    .notes: :t
      Intention and motor representation are not inferentially integrated.
    .notes: :t
      Beliefs, desires and intentions are related to the premises and conclusions
      in practical reasoning.  Motor representations are not.
      Similarly, intentions do not feature in motor processes.
  .slide
    +show('.format')
    .notes: :t
      Failure of inferential integration follows from the claim that they differ in 
      format and are not translated. But I suspect that more people will agree that there is a
      lack of inferential integration than that they differ in representational format.
      (must illustrate format with maps).

      So this is the Interface Problem: how do the outcomes specified by intentions and 
      motor representations ever nonaccidentally match?

      ‘the term apraxia was coined by Liepmann to account for higher order motor
      disorders observed in patients who, in spite of having no problem in executing
      simple actions (e.g. grasping an object), fail in actions involving more
      complex, and perhaps more conceptual, representations.’

      \citep[p.~7]{mylopoulos:2016_intentions}: ‘Typically the result of lesion
      to SMA or anterior corpus callosum, AHS is a condition in which patients
      perform complex, goal-oriented movements with their cross-lesional limb
      that they feel unable to directly inhibit or control. The limb is often
      disproportionately reactive to environmental stimuli, carrying out
      habitual behaviors that are inappropriate to the context, e.g., grabbing
      food from a dinner companion’s plate (Della Sala 2005, 606). It is clear
      from many of the behaviors observed in these cases that the anarchic limb
      fails to hook up with the agent’s intentions.’

      In the rest of this talk I’m not going to suggest a solution to the interface problem.
      Instead, I want to mention some considerations
      which may complicate attempts to solve it.
