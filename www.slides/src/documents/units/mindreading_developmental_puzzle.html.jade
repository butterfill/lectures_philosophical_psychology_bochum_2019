  An \emph{A-Task} is any false belief task that children tend to fail until around 
  three to five years of age.
.handout: :t
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Children fail A-tasks
  because they rely on a model of minds and actions that does not incorporate beliefs.
  \item Children pass non-A-tasks
  by relying on a model of minds and actions that does incorporate beliefs.
  \item At any time, the child has a single model of minds and actions.  
  \end{enumerate}
.handout: :t
  For adults (and children who can do this),
  representing perceptions and beliefs as such---and even merely holding in mind 
  what another believes, where no inference is required---involves a measurable 
  processing cost \citep{apperly:2008_back,apperly:2010_limits}, consumes attention 
  and working memory in fully competent adults \citealp{Apperly:2009cc, 
  lin:2010_reflexively, McKinnon:2007rr},  may require inhibition \citep{bull:2008_role} 
  and makes demands on executive function \citep{apperly:2004_frontal,samson:2005_seeing}.

            [Stress that, on this view, children do have a model of minds and actions.
            It’s just that it doesn’t incorporate belief.]
            Perner and others have championed the view that children who failed A-tasks
            lack a metarepresentational understanding of propositional attitudes 
            altogether.  But this view has recently (well, not that recently, it’s nearly
            a decade old now) been challenged by Hannes’ discovery
            that children can solve tasks which are like A-tasks but involve incompatible
            desires \citep{rakoczy:2007_desire}.  I think this make plausible the thought
            that there is an age at which 
            children fail A-tasks not because they have a problem with mental states
            in general, but because they have a problem with beliefs in particular.

          A non-A-Task is a task that is not an A-task.  I was tempted to call these
          B-Tasks, but that would imply that they have a unity.  And whereas we know 
          from a meta-analysis that A-tasks do seem to measure a single underlying
          competence, we don’t yet know whether all non-A-tasks measure a single thing
          or whether there might be several different things.

  .notes: :t
    The puzzle is a little bit like the puzzle we had in the case of knowledge
    of physical objects.
    But it's also different.
    In the case of physical objects, the conflict was between measures
    involving looking and measures involving searching.
    In this case it's different, because on the infant side there is not just
    looking but also acting (e.g. helping) and even communicating.
