description: """
  How do infants (and adults) track the goals of others’ actions?
  According to the Motor Theory of Goal Tracking, it is sometimes* by 
  means of motor processes.
  More carefully, the Motor Theory of Goal Tracking consists of these claims: 
  (1) in action observation, possible outcomes of observed actions are represented motorically;
  (2) these representations trigger motor processes much as if the observer were performing actions
  directed to the outcomes;
  (3) such processes generates predictions;
  (4) a triggering representation is weakened if the predictions it generates fail.
  The result is that, often enough, the only only outcomes to which the observed action is a means
  are represented strongly.
  
  (*‘sometimes’ because the Motor Theory is part of a dual-process account of goal-tracking.)

  \emph{The Motor Theory of Goal Tracking}
  Infants’ pure goal-tracking depends on the double life of motor processes.
.handout: :t
  According to the \emph{Motor Theory of Goal Tracking}, infants (and adults) sometimes track the
  goals of others’ by means of motor processes \citep[see][for details]{sinigaglia:2015_puzzle}.
.handout: :t
  More carefully  the \emph{Motor Theory of Goal Tracking} states that: 
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item in action observation, possible outcomes of observed actions are represented motorically;
  \item these representations trigger motor processes much as if the observer were performing actions directed to the outcomes;
  \item such processes generates predictions;
  \item a triggering representation is weakened if the predictions it generates fail.
  \end{enumerate}
  The result is that, often enough, the only only outcomes to which the observed action is a means
  are represented strongly.

      ‘The present experiments nonetheless cast doubt on the proposal that manipulations of
      first-person action experience facilitate the construction of the very concept of a
      goal or the principle of rational action. 
    p.notes.handout.ctd.show: :t
      Instead, we suggest that these interventions provide
      infants with more specific knowledge that enables them to identify the agent’s goal, and that
      infants can then reason about this goal in accordance with more general assumptions that exist
      independently of the manipulated action experience.’

  p.center The Double Life of Motor Representation
  .notes: :t
    Suppose you are reaching for, grasping, transporting and then placing a pen. Performing even
    relatively simple action sequences like this involves satisfying many constraints that cannot
    normally be satisfied by explicit practical reasoning, especially if performance is to be rapid and
    fluent. Rather, such performances require motor representations.
    These representations are paradigmatically involved in preparing, executing and monitoring actions.%
    \footnote{%
    See \citet{wolpert:1995internal, miall:1996_forward, jeannerod:1998nbo, zhang:2007_planning}.
    Note that motor representations sometimes occur in an agent who has prepared an action and is required (as it turns out) not to perform it: although she has prevented herself from acting, motor representations specifying the action persist, perhaps because they are necessary for monitoring whether prevention has succeeded \citep{bonini:2014_ventral}.
    }
    But they also live a double life. Motor representations concerning a particular type of action are
    involved not only in performing an action of that type but also sometimes in observing one. That is,
    if you were to observe Ayesha reach for, grasp, transport and then place a pen, motor representations
    would occur in you much like those that would also occur in you if it were you---not Ayesha---who was
    doing this.

    Converging evidence for this assertion comes from a variety of methods and measures;
    but I won’t mention any of that here.

    mTgt is an alternative to the Simple View.
    The idea is that pure goal-tracking involves motor processes rather than thinking
    and reasoning about goals.
  .notes: :t
    But how could motor processes enable goal tracking?
  
  .slide
    +show('.speech')
    .notes: :t
      At this point it is helpful to think about speech.
      To utter a phoneme is to produce complex coordinated movements of the 
      lips, larynx, tongue and velum.
      Further, how these should be moved and what sound should be produced depends on
      many factors including phonemic context, rate of speech and prosody. 
    .notes: :t
      So uttering a phoneme is unlike pressing a key on a piano keyboard:
      it not a matter of producing a particular sound
      but of performing a complex, goal-directed action.
    .notes: :t
      We know from Riikka Möttönen’s research that there is striking new
      evidence for what is sometimes called the Motor Theory of Speech Perception.
    .notes: :t
      So speech perception is special case of goal-tracking.
      The perceiver’s task is to recover the goal to which the utterance of a phoneme is directed.
    .notes: :t
      mTgt is simply a generalisation of the Motor Theory of Speech Perception
    .notes: :t
      In performing an action, there are motor processes which compute means given goals.
      The same processes can be used when observing an action for tracking goals.

    Goal-tracking is acting in reverse.
    -- in action observation, possible outcomes of observed actions are represented
    -- these representations trigger planning as if performing actions directed to the outcomes
    -- such planning generates predictions
    -- a triggering representation is weakened if its predictions fail
    The result is that the only only outcomes to which the observed action is a means
    are represented strongly.
  .notes: :t
    There is evidence that a motor representation of an outcome can cause a determination of which
    movements are likely to be performed to achieve that outcome \citep[see, for
    instance,][]{kilner:2004_motor, urgesi:2010_simulating}. Further, the processes involved in
    determining how observed actions are likely to unfold given their outcomes are closely related,
    or identical, to processes involved in performing actions.
    This is known in part thanks to studies of how observing actions can facilitate performing
    actions congruent with those observed, and can interfere with performing incongruent actions
    \citep{
    	brass:2000_compatibility, 
    	craighero:2002_hand, 
    	kilner:2003_interference, 
    	costantini:2012_does}. 
    Planning-like processes in action observation have also been demonstrated by measuring observers' predictive gaze.  If you were to observe just the early phases of a grasping movement, your eyes might jump to its likely target, ignoring nearby objects \citep{ambrosini:2011_grasping}. These proactive eye movements resemble those you would typically make if you were acting yourself \citep{Flanagan:2003lm}. 
    Importantly, the occurrence of such proactive eye movements in action observation depends on your
    representing the outcome of an action motorically; even temporary interference in the observer's
    motor abilities will interfere with the eye movements \citep{Costantini:2012fk}.
    These proactive eye movements also depend on planning-like processes; requiring the observer to
    perform actions incongruent with those she is observing can eliminate proactive eye movements
    \citep{Costantini:2012uq}. This, then, is further evidence for planning-like motor processes in
    action observation.
  .notes: :t
    So observers represent outcomes motorically and these representations trigger planning-like processes
    which generate expectations about how the observed actions will unfold and their sensory consequences.
    Now the mere occurrence of these processes is not sufficient to explain why, in action observation,
    an outcome represented motorically is likely to be an outcome to which the observed action is
    directed.
  .notes: :t
    To take a tiny step further, we conjecture that, in action observation, \textbf{motor representations of
    outcomes are weakened to the extent that the expectations they generate are unmet}
    \citep[compare][]{Fogassi:2005nf}.
    A motor representation of an outcome to which an observed action is not directed is likely to
    generate incorrect expectations about how this action will unfold, and failures of these
    expectations to be met will weaken the representation.
    This is what ensures that there is a correspondence between outcomes represented motorically in
    observing actions and the goals of those actions.

    The dual-process theory of goal-tracking makes perfect sense of development.
    It says that what we observe in six- and nine-month-olds is motor-based goal-tracking.
    Presumably the more flexible, reasoning-based goal-tracking processes emerge some time
    later in development.

    Relation to Q3: special system, namely the motor system.
  .notes: :t
    Relation to Q6 [How do these processes relate to theory of mind abilities (e.g. Simmons et al.,
    2009)?]:
    It looks like, in endorsing mTgt, we are postulating a discrepancy between goal-tracking and
    theory of mind abilities, since theory of mind abilities are perhaps unlikely to depend on motor
    processes in the way in which goal-tracking does. 
    However, we should probably be cautious here; in pilot research with Jason Low, we have some
    preliminary evidence that some theory of mind abilities may be more closely tied to motor processes
    than anyone has yet imagined.
