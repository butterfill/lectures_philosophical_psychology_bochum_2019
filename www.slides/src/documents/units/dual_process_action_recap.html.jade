    You see a rat and a lever.
    The rat presses the lever occasionally.
    Now you start rewarding the rat:
    when it presses the lever it is rewarded with a particular kind of food.
    As a consequence, the rat presses the lever more often.

    p Is this lever pressing habitual or instrumental aciton?

      Solution is to stop thinking that actions can be just one or the other.

    Earlier I asked,
    You see a rat and a lever.
    The rat presses the lever occasionally.
    Now you start rewarding the rat:
    when it presses the lever it is rewarded with a particular kind of food.
    As a consequence, the rat presses the lever more often.
  p.q1 Is this lever pressing habitual or instrumental aciton?
