title: "How are infants first able to track goals?"

description: """
  The Teleological Stance provides a computational description of goal tracking.
  It hinges on the principle that the goals of an action are those outcomes which the means are a
  best available way of bringing about.
  Given this principle, we can infer goals from means by identifying which outcomes the means 
  are a best available way of bringing about.
  But how is this computation performed?

    .notes: :t
      So planning is the process of moving from goals to means,
      whereas tracking goes in the reverse direction, from means to goals.
      But what is common to the two is the relation between means and goals.
      In both cases, planning and goal-tracking, the means that are adopted should be a best available
      way of bringing the goal about.

      Note that this is not exactly an answer to our question,
      How can infants track goals from nine months of age (or earlier)?
      It provides what Marr would call a computational description.
    .notes: :t
      That is, it provides a function
      from 
      facts about events and states of affairs that could be known without knowing which goals any
      particular actions are directed to, nor any facts about particular mental states
      to 
      one or more outcomes which are the goals of an action.
    .notes: :t
      Providing this function explains how pure goal-tracking is possible in principle.
    .notes: :t
      But what we want to know, of course, is how infants (and adults) actually compute this function.
      If this is (roughly) the function which computationally describes pure goal tracking,
      what are the representations and processes involved in pure goal tracking?

  .notes: :t
    The principles comprising the Teleological Stance are things we know or believe, and we are
    able to track goals by making inferences from these principles and our beliefs about the
    means someone is pursuing.
  .notes: :t
    Infants and adults engaged in goal-tracking reason about 
    to which outcome a means is the best available
    in fundamentally the same way that you or I do when trying to work it out explicitly.

      Relation to Q3: no special system.
      [Q3: Are these properties and happenings tracked by modality specific systems, or are they tracked by
      special purpose perceptual mechanisms of their own (e.g. Liberman, 1967)/ cross-modal objects of
      perception?]

      Relation to Q6: teleological stance is continuous with mindreading (the latter merely involves
      using an enriched model with includes mental states; the two can be parts of a single process).
      [Q6: How do these processes relate to theory of mind abilities (e.g. Simmons et al., 2009)?]

      Assume an action is directed to some goal; an outcome, G, is among the goals of this action
      if none of the following are untrue:
    ol
      li.hem-above actions of this type are normally means of realising outcomes of G’s type;
      li.hem-above no available alternative action is a significantly better* means of realising outcome G;
      li.hem-above the occurrence of outcome G is desirable;

      To solve this problem, we need to start with an account of pure goal tracking.
    .notes: :t
      An account of pure goal tracking is an account of how you could 
      in principle infer facts about the goals to which actions are directed from
      facts about joint displacements, bodily configurations and their effects 
      (e.g. sounds).
      Such an account is a computational theory of pure goal tracking.
