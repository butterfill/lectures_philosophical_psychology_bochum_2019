  Many behaviours exhibited by infants, including anticipatory looking, looking

  One-year-old children predict actions of agents with false beliefs about the
  locations of objects \citep{Clements:1994cw,Onishi:2005hm,Southgate:2007js},
  and about the contents of containers \citep{he:2011_false}, taking into
  account verbal communication \citep{Song:2008qo,scott:2012_verbal_fb}.
  They
  will also choose ways of helping \citep[]{Buttelmann:2009gy} and
  communicating \citep{Knudsen:2011fk,southgate:2010fb} with others depending on
  whether their beliefs are true or false. And in much the way that irrelevant
  facts about the contents of others’ beliefs modulate adult subjects’ response
  times, such facts also affect how long 7-month-old infants look at some
  stimuli \citep[]{kovacs_social_2010}.

    It turns out that, in the first and second years of life, infants show abilities 
    to track false beliefs on a variety of measures.

            A non-A-Task is a task that is not an A-task.  I was tempted to call these
            B-Tasks, but that would imply that they have a unity.  And whereas we know 
            from a meta-analysis that A-tasks do seem to measure a single underlying
            competence, we don’t yet know whether all non-A-tasks measure a single thing
            or whether there might be several different things.

              Why do infants systematically pass non-A-tasks in the first year
              or two of life? There is a simple explanation ...

            p.invert(style='margin-top:3em;margin-left:10em;') by relying on a model of minds and actions that does incorporate beliefs
            .notes: :t
              And this is *almost* everything we need to generate the puzzle about development.

    There are some problems with replication, and with whether the different methods
    identify a single capacity. This is a significant issue, but not one I can address here.

    What got me hooked philosophical psychology, 
    and on philosophical issues in the development of mindreading in particular 
    was a brilliant finding by Wendy Clements who was Josef Perner's phd student.
