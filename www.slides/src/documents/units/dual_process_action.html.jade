  Actions are neither habitual or instrumental.

    Earlier I asked,
    You see a rat and a lever.
    The rat presses the lever occasionally.
    Now you start rewarding the rat:
    when it presses the lever it is rewarded with a particular kind of food.
    As a consequence, the rat presses the lever more often.
  p.q1 Is this lever pressing habitual or instrumental aciton?

    Now we can say the question is confused.

    p.em-above Are the causes of this action habitual or instrumental?

      In the PFC, lesions of the prelimbic and infralimbic areas disrupt goal-directed and habitual

      These dissociations suggest that different neural
      circuits mediate the two forms of control’
