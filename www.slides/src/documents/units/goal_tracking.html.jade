    An account of pure goal ascription is an account of how you could 
    in principle infer facts about the goals to which actions are directed from
    facts about joint displacements, bodily configurations and their effects 
    (e.g. sounds).
    Such an account is a computational theory of pure goal ascription.

  .notes: :t
    Two forms of goal ascription, representational and functional (\citealp{gallese:2011_what}).
    In \emph{representational goal ascription}, three things must be represented: an action, an outcome and the relation between this outcome and the action in virtue of which the outcome is a goal of the action.
    % jacob:2012_sharing: ‘Ascribing a goal to an agent consists in forming a belief (or judgment) about an agent that he or she has a goal or is performing some goal-directed action.’
    In \emph{functional goal ascription}, the relation between action and outcome is captured without being represented.
    To say that this relation is \emph{captured} is to say that there is a process which ensures that the outcome represented is a goal of the action.

    .notes: :t
      Motor representations cannot suffice for representational goal ascription. 
      It is true that, in someone observing an action there can be motor representations of outcomes which, non accidentally, are the goals of the observed action.
      But this is not enough.
      There would have to be, in addition, a motor representation of an intention, or of a motor representation or of some other goal-state, or of a function. 
      But there are no such motor representations.

      Our primary concern here with behaviour reading is as a potential basis for abilities to track others’ mental states without representing them.
      But behaviour reading is plausibly important in other ways.
      In mindreaders, behaviour reading is thought to be useful or even necessary for identifying intentions and other mental states (\citealp[p.~861]{Newtson:1977dw}; \citealp[p.~708]{Baldwin:2001rn}).
      Behaviour reading may also matter for efficiently representing events \citep{Kurby:2008bk}, identifing the likely effects of actions \citep{Byrne:1999jk}, predicting when an event likely to be of interest will occur \citep[p.~121]{Swallow:2008cf},
      and learning through observation how to do things \citep{Byrne:2003wx}.
      And of course a special case of pure behaviour reading, ‘speech perception’, underpins communication by language in humans.

  .notes: :t
    Start with a case in which behaviour reading is clearly involved.
    I take Byrne’s study
    to demonstrate that chimps are capable of sophisticated behaviour reading.
    But how might they represent behaviours?
  .notes: :t
    The procedure for preparing a nettle to eat while avoiding contact with its stings is shown in
    \vref{fig:byrne_2003_fig1}. It involves multiple steps. Some steps may be repeated varying numbers of
    times, and not all steps occur in every case. The fact that gorillas can learn this and other
    procedures for acquiring and preparing food by observing others’ behaviour suggests that they have
    sophisticated behaviour reading abilities \citep[p.~513]{Byrne:2003wx}. If we understood the nature
    of these behaviour reading abilities and their limits, we might be better able to understand their
    abilities to track mental states too.

    So even quite sophisticated behaviour reading is possible without any
    reliance on communication by language.
    We can therefore think of behaviour reading as foundational for any kind 
    of radical interpretation.

    [background]
    ‘Nettles, Laportea alatipes, are an important food of mountain gorillas in Rwanda (Watts 1984), 
    rich in protein and low in secondary compounds and structural carbohydrate (Waterman et al. 1983). 
    Unfortunately for the gorillas, this plant is 'defended' by powerful stinging hairs, 
    especially dense on the stem, petioles and leaf-edges. 
    All gorillas in the local population process nettles in broadly the same way, 
    a technique that minimizes contact of sting- ing hairs with their hands and 
    lips (Byrne & Byrne 1991; figure 1). A series of small transformations is 
    made to plant material: stripping leaves off stems, accumulating
    larger bundles of leaves, detachment of petioles, picking out unwanted debris, 
    and finally folding a package of leaf blades within a single leaf before 
    ingestion. The means by which each small change is made are idiosyncratic and
    variable with context (Byrne & Byrne 1993), thus presum- ably best learned 
    by individual experience. However, the overall sequence of five discrete 
    stages in the process is standardized and appears to be essential for efficiency
    (Byrne et al. 2001a).’ \citep[pp.~531--2]{Byrne:2003wx}
  .notes: :t
    ‘Like other complex feeding tasks in great apes, preparing nettles is a hierarchically 
    organized skill, showing considerable flexibility: stages that are occasionally 
    unnecessary are omitted, and sections of the process (of one or several ordered stages) 
    are often repeated iteratively to a criterion apparently based on an adequate size of 
    food bundle (Byrne & Russon 1998).’ \citep[pp.~532]{Byrne:2003wx}

    p segmentation: Where does an action begin an end?
    .notes: :t
      Behaviour reading involves at least three components: segmentation, categorisation and structure extraction.
      First, it is necessary to segment continuous streams of bodily movements into units of interest.
      Adult humans can readily impose boundaries on continuous sequences of behaviour \citep{Newtson:1976ni,Zacks:2001ua,Kurby:2008bk}, as can infants \citep{Baldwin:2001rs}.
      Segmentation is probably complicated by the fact that units are not performed one after another but can overlap, as when you bat away a fly while squeezing a lemon and talking on the phone.
      A further complication is that identifying unit boundaries probably involves taking into account the context in which a behaviour occurs \citep[p.~847]{Newtson:1977dw}.
      How could segmentation be achieved?
      Commencement and completion of a goal or subgoal typically coincide with dramatic changes in physical features of the movements such as velocity \citep{Zacks:2001vo}.
      Baldwin and Baird express this idea graphically with the notion of a ‘ballistic trajectory’ that provides an ‘envelope’ for a unit of action \citep[p.~174]{Baldwin:2001rs}.
      Research using schematic animations has shown that adults can use a variety of movement features to group behavioural chunks into units
      \citep{Zacks:2004vd,Hard:2006gr}.
    .slide
      p categorisation: What is the type of that action?
      .notes: :t
        A second component of behaviour reading is categorisation.
        Adult humans spontaneously label units of behaviour as ‘running’, ‘grasping’, or ‘searching’ (say).
        This is categorisation: two units which may involve quite different bodily configurations and joint displacements and which may occur in quite different contexts are nevertheless treated as equivalent.
        How are categories identified in pure behaviour reading?
        One possibility is that some categorisation processes involve mirroring motor cognition.
        When a monkey or a human observes another’s action, there are often motor representations in her that would normally occur if it were her, the observer, who was performing the action (see \citealp[][]{rizzolatti_functional_2010,rizzolatti_mirrors_2008} for reviews).
        Further, in preparing, performing and monitoring actions, units of action are represented motorically in ways that abstract from particular patterns of joint displacements and bodily configurations \citep[e.g.][]{rizzolatti:1988_functional, Rizzolatti:2001ug, hamilton:2008_action, cattaneo:2010_state-dependent,Umilta:2001zr, villiger:2010_activity, koch:2010_resonance}.
        And, in observation as performance, what is represented motorically depends on contextual factors such as the presence of particular objects on which certain actions might be performed (\citealp{Gallese:2011uq}).
        Taken together, these findings indicate that %there may be a deep connection between processes involved in action performance and one process of categorisation in behaviour reading.
        %Perhaps
        one process by which units of action are categorised is the process by which, in other contexts, your own actions are prepared.
    .slide
      p structure extraction: Are these actions related to those?
      .notes: :t
        A third component of behaviour reading is structure extraction.
        Many actions can be analysed as a structure of goals hierarchically ordered by the means-ends relation
        A behaviour reader should be able to extract some or all of this structure.
        But how?
        Units of behaviour that are all involved in bringing about a single outcome are more likely to occur in succession than chunks not so related.
        This suggests that transitional probabilities in the sequence of units could in principle be used to identify larger structures of units, much as phonemes can be grouped into words by means of tracking transitional probabilities \citep{Saffran:1996aj,Gomez:2000jr}.
        We know that human adults can learn to group small chunks of behaviour into larger word-like units on the basis of statistical features alone \citep{Baldwin:2008mw}.
        A statistical learning mechanism required for discerning such units is automatic \citep{Fiser:2001cx}, domain-general \citep{Kirkham:2002cj} and probably present in human infants \citep{saffran:2007_dog} as well as other species including monkeys \citep{Hauser:2001oo}, pigeons \citep{herbranson:_artificial},
        songbirds \citep{abe:2011_songbirds} and rats \citep{Toro:2005ma,murphy:2008_rule}.
        It is therefore plausible that at least some animals’ pure behaviour reading abilities enable them to extract some of the hierarchical structure of actions.
    .slide
      p goal ascription: What is the goal of those actions?
      .notes: :t
        Here I think the teleological stance (which may involve motor processes) 
        is helpful.
