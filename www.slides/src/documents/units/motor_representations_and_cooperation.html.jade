       Recall our issue earlier with the Simple View
    +blur('img', '5px', 0)
    p.center diagnosis: cooperation
    .notes: :t
      The counterexample shows that you can meet the conditions of the Simple
      Account without cooperating or being disposed to cooperate.
      But, arguably, shared agency involves cooperation in some way.

  p.notes.handout.show: :t
    Where our actions have a collective goal in virtue of an interagential structure 
    of motor representations, we are not merely acting together: we are acting as one.
  .notes: :t
    Why is this true? 
    Because in the sort of parallel-planning triggered by the motor representations in 
    an interagential structure of motor representations, there is no distinction
    between actions I will perform and actions you will perform.
  .notes: :t
    I am, in effect, just trying to work out the best way to achieve the outcome irrespective 
    of who does what; and so are you; and this is the hallmark of effective cooperation.

+slide_middle
  p.center the Simple View revised
  .notes: :t
    Let's go back to the Simple View ...




+slide({bkg:'tarantino_walkers.jpg'})
  +hide('img.bkg', 0)
  +simple_account
  .slide
    +invert('.phi')
    .notes: :t
      We have to be careful in specifying under what description they intend that they phi.
      To avoid circularity can't always be the case that phi is an intentional joint action.
      Bratman says it is cooperatively neutral.
      This is weak.
      Maybe we can say:
  .slide
    p.em-above.notes.show.desc-phi-v1 φ comprises two or more actions involving multiple agents where the actions have a collective goal 
      span.in-virtue in virtue of an interagential structure of motor representation
      span .
  .slide
    +show('img.bkg')
    .notes: :t()
      I think this gets around the Tarrantino walkers counterexample.
      (Because if you have the iasmr you don't need a gun!)
  .slide
    +blur('img.bkg', '5px')
    +fade('img.bkg')
    .notes: :t()
      But it leaves us with another problem ...
  .slide
    +invert('.in-virtue')
    .notes: :t()
      People can't intend phi under this description unless they can identify the 
      interagential structure of motor representation we have been characterising.
  .slide
    +uninvert('.in-virtue')
    +line-through('.desc-phi-v1')  
    .notes: :t()
      So we have to give up on this idea as it stands.
      But maybe we can modify it.
  .slide
    p.em-above interagential structure of motor representation grounds collective goal
    p.indent > experience of act type 
    p.indent > concept of act type
  .slide
    p.em-above.notes.show.desc-phi-v2 φ is an act-type we know through experiences arising from interagential structure of motor representations grounding collective goals.
    .notes: :t()
      Compare individual action.
      We know what it is to grasp by virtue of experiences created by motor representations.
      ...
