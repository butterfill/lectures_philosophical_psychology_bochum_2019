    Let me go back and start with some almost uncontroversial facts about motor representations and 
    their action-coordinating role.
  .notes: :t
    Why postulate motor representations at all?  [Dependence of present actions on future actions
    is one reason for doing so.]
  .slide

    .notes: :t
      Suppose you are a cook who needs to take an egg from its box, crack it and put it (except for the
      shell) into a bowl ready for beating into a carbonara sauce.
      Even for such mundane, routine actions, the constraints on adequate performance can vary
      significantly depending on subtle variations in context. For example, the position of a hot pan
      may require altering the trajectory along which the egg is transported, or time pressures may mean
      that the action must be performed unusually swiftly on this occasion.
      Further, many of the constraints on performance involve relations between actions occurring at
      different times.
      To illustrate, how tightly you need to grip the egg now depends, among other things, on the forces
      to which you will subject the egg in lifting it later.
      It turns out that people reliably grip objects such as eggs just tightly enough across a range of
      conditions in which the optimal tightness of grip varies.
      This indicates (along with much other evidence) that information about the cook’s anticipated
      future hand and arm movements appropriately influences how tightly she initially grips the egg
      (compare \citealp{kawato:1999_internal}).
      This anticipatory control of grasp, 
      like several other features of action performance (\citealp[see][chapter 1]{rosenbaum:2010_human} for more examples),
      is not plausibly a consequence of mindless physiology, nor of intention and practical reasoning.
      This is one reason for postulating motor representations, which characteristically play a role in
      coordinating sequences of very small scale actions such as grasping an egg in order to lift it.
    .notes: :t
      [The scale of an actual action can be defined in terms of means-end relations.  
      Given two actions which are related as means to ends by the processes and representations 
      involved in their performance, the first is smaller in scale than the second just if the 
      first is a means to the second.  Generalising, we associate the scale of an actual action 
      with the depth of the hierarchy of outcomes that are related to it by the transitive closure 
      of the means-ends relation.  Then, generalising further, a repeatable action (something that 
      different agents might do independently on several occasions) is associated with a scale 
      characteristic of the things people do when they perform that action.  Given that actions 
      such as cooking a meal or painting a house count as small-scale actions, actions such as 
      grasping an egg or dipping a brush into a can of paint are very-small scale.  Note that we 
      do not stipulate a tight link between the very small scale and the motoric.  In some cases 
      intentions may play a role in coordinating sequences of very small scale purposive actions, 
      and in some cases motor representations may concern actions which are not very small scale.  
      The claim we wish to consider is only that, often enough, explaining the coordination of 
      sequences of very small scale actions appears to involve representations but not, or not 
      only, intentions.  To a first approximation, \emph{motor representation} is a label for 
      such representations.%
      \footnote{% 
      Much more to be said about what motor representations are; for instance, see \citet{butterfill:2012_intention} for the view that motor representations can be distinguished by representational format.

      What do motor representations represent? An initially attractive, conservative 
      view would be that they represent bodily configurations and joint displacements, 
      or perhaps sequences of these, only.

      However there is now a significant body of evidence that some motor representations 
      do not specify particular sequences of bodily configurations and joint displacements, 
      but rather represent outcomes such as the grasping of an egg or the pressing of a switch.  
      These are outcomes which might, on different occasions, involve very different bodily 
      configurations and joint displacements
      (see \citealp{rizzolatti_functional_2010} for a selective review).
    .notes: :t
      Such outcomes are abstract relative to bodily configurations and joint displacements 
      in that there are many different ways of achieving them.

      Since this is important, let me pause for a moment.
      To say that something is an outcome is not to say very much: merely that it is a 
      possible or actual state of affairs which is brought about in some way by an action.
    .notes: :t
      What I mean is that motor representations represent the sort of outcomes that are plausibly
      thought of as goals of actions, things such as transporting and breaking an egg,
      or flipping a switch.
    .notes: :t
      This kind of outcomes are quite different from both patterns of joint displacement and 
      bodily movements and also from end states.

    .notes: :t
      In my terms, a goal is merely outcome.
      Contrast goals with goal-states, which are mental or functional states which specify goals. 
      A motor representation is a goal-state; the goal is the thing it represents.

      Motor schema are just motor representations which specify incomplete outcomes.
      [Of course schema are incomplete, so do not specify outcomes but outcome types.]
    .notes: :t
      Motor schema are ‘internal models or stored representations that represent generic knowledge about
      a certain pattern of action and are implicated in the production and control of action’
      \citep{mylopoulos:2016_intentions}.
    .notes: :t
      ‘Motor schemas are more abstract and stable representations of actions than motor
      representations.’
    .notes: :t
      ‘They are internal models or stored representations that represent generic knowledge
      about a certain pattern of action and are implicated in the production and control of
      action. For instance, in the influential Motor Schema Theory proposed by Richard Schmidt
      (1975, 2003), a motor schema involves a generalized motor program, together with corre-
      sponding ‘recall’ and ‘recognition’ schemas. The generalized motor program is thought to
      contain an abstract representation defining the general form or pattern of an action,
      that is the organization and structure common to a set of motor acts (e.g., invariant
      features pertaining to the order of events, their spatial configuration, their relative
      timing and the relative force with which they are produced). This generalized motor
      program has parameters that control it. In order to determine how an action should be
      performed on a given occasion, parameter values adapted to the situation must be
      specified. Thus, a motor schema also includes a rule or system of rules describing the
      relationships between initial conditions, parameter values and outcomes and allowing us
      to perform the action over a large range of conditions (the ‘recall schema’ in Schmidt’s
      terminology). Finally, the motor schema also includes a rule or system of rules
      describing the relationships between initial conditions, exteroceptive and propri-
      oceptive sensory feedback during an action, and action outcome (a recognition sche- ma),
      allowing agents to know when they have made an error – i.e., the action does not have
      the sensory consequences it is expected to have – and to correct for it.’
    .notes: :t
      Are motor schemas an alterantive to motor representations? Tempting to think that where
      they talk about motor schema, we think of motor representations that represent outcomes
      that are relatively distal from action (e.g. are affector-neutral).
    .notes: :t
      This would explain why they contrast motor schema with motor programmes. We use ‘motor
      representation’ to include both.
  
+slide({bkg:'motor_representation_fig/Slide02.jpg'})
  .notes: :t
    A goal represented motorically triggers a process which, via computations of things 
    like end states, starting states and smoothness, eventually results in joint
    displacements; and when things go well, these joint displacements together with the 
    resulting bodily configurations bring about, or constitute, the occurrence of the goal.
    
+slide({bkg:'motor_representation_fig/Slide03.jpg'})
  .notes: :t
    But of course this is a simplification. Motor representations can trigger processes
    which result in further goals being represented, as for example when a motor 
    representation of the transporting of an object triggers representations of reaching,
    grasping, placing and releasing.

      The experiments providing such evidence typically involve a marker of motor representation, 
      such as a pattern of neuronal firings, a motor evoked potential or a behavioural performance 
      profile, which, in controlled settings, allows sameness or difference of motor representation 
      to be distinguished.  Such markers can be exploited to show that the sameness and difference 
      of motor representation is linked to the sameness and difference of an outcome such as the 
      grasping of a particular object.
      (Pioneering uses of this method include \citealp{rizzolatti:1988_functional,Rizzolatti:2001ug};

    To illustrate, consider a sequence of actions which might be involved in shoplifting an apple: you have to secure the apple, transport it, and position it in your pocket.
    Each of these outcomes can be represented motorically.
+slide_middle({bkg:'planning_like/Slide2.jpg'})
  .notes: :t
    Motor processes are planning-like in that they involve computing means from ends.
    Thus a representation of an end like securing it [the apple] can trigger a process 
    that results in the representation of outcomes that are means to this end.
    
+slide_middle({bkg:'planning_like/Slide3.jpg'})
  .notes: :t
    Motor processes are also planning-like in that which means are selected in preparing an 
    action that will occur early in the sequence may affect needs that will arise only later 
    in a later part of the actions.
    For instance, how the apple is grasped at an early point in the sequence may be determined 
    in part by what would be a more comfortable way for the other hand to grasp it later.
+slide_middle({bkg:'planning_like/Slide4.jpg'})
  .notes: :t
    So motor representations of outcomes guide planning-like processes.
    This is why I think it’s not just that they carry information about outcomes
    like grasping an apple, but that they also represent such outcomes.
