    ‘There are some cases … in which a causal impression arises, clear, genuine, and unmistakable, 
    and the idea of cause can be derived from it by simple abstraction in just the same way as the 
    idea of shape or movement can be derived from the perception of shape or movement’

      So far I don't think we have strong reasons to accept that they do.
      In infants we have discrimination and in adults we have verbal reports.
      But we shouldn't trust verbal reports.
      After all, people will say all kinds of things about their experiences.
      This is nicely illustrated by a famous experiment on apparent behaviour by \citet{Heider:1944ts}.

      p.em-above Michotte: the experience of launching depends on interactions among various factors including 
      ul
        li the relative speeds of the two objects
        li the delay between the first and second objects’ movements
        li the spatial gap between the two objects 
        li the trajectories of the two objects. 
    .notes: :t
      But how does this help us?  Importantly, tiny variations in the parameters will make 
      big differences in the experiences reported.
      Let me illustrate this for the delay between the objects' movements.

    People can distinguish between stimuli that differ only in that the gap between two movements
    is approximately 50ms longer in one than the other.
    A 50ms difference makes the difference between reporting launching and reporting two movements.

    We need to do more to understand the effect, ...

    NB: Rips 2011 notes that missing out the third category of judgement
    makes the case for categorical perception seem different than it is.

    The question was how we can get beyond intuition in understanding the verbal reports.
    I don’t think the argument offered about how to explain the conditions under which the 
    launching effect works is obvious successful.
    But I do think it’s right to ignore verbal reports in favour of an attempt to get at the
    nature of the processes that explain the launching effect.
  p How to get beyond intuition?
  p The launching effect: detecting a 50ms difference in the delay between two movements.
  .notes: :t
    Part of the answer is this.  We don't worry about the content of the verbal reports.
    We just focus on the fact that their content changes depending on a tiny, 50 millisecond
    difference in the delay between two movements.
    Call this \emph{launching effect}.
  .notes: :t
    This doesn't tell us what people are detecting.
    But it does tell us that the effect is not merely confabulation or making it up.
    So we have taken a tiny step beyond intuition.  But we also have to answer two questions.

      li.hem-around.focus How is launching detected?  For example, does it involve perceptual processes?
      li.hem-around Why is a delay of up to around 70ms consistent with the launching effect occuring?
