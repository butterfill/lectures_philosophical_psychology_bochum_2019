    ‘There are some cases … in which a causal impression arises, clear, genuine, and unmistakable, 
    and the idea of cause can be derived from it by simple abstraction in just the same way as the 
    idea of shape or movement can be derived from the perception of shape or movement’

  p.center detecting launching effects at 6 months
  .notes: :t
    This effect, or one very like
    it, can also be found in infancy. 
  .notes: :t
    Of course, six-month-olds can't tell us about their expeirences.
    So how can we tell that they detect launching effects?

    Infants at around six months of age seem also to distinguish launching from other sequences, 
    much as adults do \citep{Leslie:1987nr}.
  .notes: :t
    [nb: Several people have discussed this in seminars so I won't discuss it here (the reference is on your handout).]
  .notes: :t
    In their experiment, they compared two groups of infants.
    The first group was habituated to the top display, which is just the sort of animation Michotte
    used to get reports of causal experiences in adults.
    After habituation, this first group was then shown the same display except that the direction was 
    reversed.
    Meanwhile a second group was habituated to a display like the top display here except 
    that there was a delay between the first object stopping and the second object starting.
    This delay would mean that, in adults, there are no reports of experiences of a causal interaction.
    After habituation, this second group was shown the same display except that the direction of 
    movement was reversed.
  .notes: :t
    Of interest was whether the first group showed greater dishabituation to the reversal than 
    the second group.
    How could this tell us anything about infants' experiences?
    Suppose that infants do not have anything like what adults report as an experience of causation.
    They they experience merely patterns of movement.
    And, in this case, reversing on sequence should create no more interest than reversing the other.
    But now suppose that infants do have something like what adults report as an experience 
    of causation?
    Then, when reversing the first sequence, there are two changes: there is a change both to the 
    movement and to the character of the causal interaction.  To put it informally,
    reversing direction means that the patient of the interaction becomes its agent.
    So the hypothesis that infants' experiences of Michotte-like stimuli resemble adults 
    predicts that there will be greater dishabituation when the first, `direct launching` sequence 
    is reversed.

    This result seems robust:
    \citep[p.~ 30]{hubbard:2012_phenomenala}: ‘Belanger and Desrochers (2001) replicated findings of
    Leslie and Keeble (1987) and others that 6-month old infants dishabituated more to reversal of a
    launching effect stimulus than to reversal of a noncausal (spatial gap or temporal gap) stimulus.’
    
    \citep[pp.~ 30--1]{hubbard:2012_phenomenala}:‘Schlottmann et al. (2012) habituated 4-, 5-, and
    6-month old infants to displays of a (a) reaction effect stimulus or (b) reaction effect stimulus
    with a temporal gap between the launcher and the target. ... The data were consistent with Leslie
    and Keeble’s (1987) finding that 6-month old infants dishabituated more to a reversal of a launching
    effect stimulus than to a reversal of a noncausal stimulus.’
    
  .notes: :t
    This paradigm also works with chimps:
    \citep[p.~505]{hubbard:2012_phenomenal}: ‘O’Connell and Dunbar (2005) adapted the habituation paradigm used with human infants (e.g., Leslie 1982; Leslie and Keeble 1987) and presented causal stimuli or noncausal stimuli to chimpanzees. Dishabituation was greater for chimpanzees habituated to a causal stimulus and presented with a noncausal stimulus than for chimpanzees habituated to a noncausal stimulus and presented with a causal stimulus, and this was interpreted as consistent with causal perception.’

      So far I don't think we have strong reasons to accept that they do.
      In infants we have discrimination and in adults we have verbal reports.
      But we shouldn't trust verbal reports.
      After all, people will say all kinds of things about their experiences.
      This is nicely illustrated by a famous experiment on apparent behaviour by \citet{Heider:1944ts}.

      p.em-above Michotte: the experience of launching depends on interactions among various factors including 
      ul
        li the relative speeds of the two objects
        li the delay between the first and second objects’ movements
        li the spatial gap between the two objects 
        li the trajectories of the two objects. 
    .notes: :t
      But how does this help us?  Importantly, tiny variations in the parameters will make 
      big differences in the experiences reported.
      Let me illustrate this for the delay between the objects' movements.

    People can distinguish between stimuli that differ only in that the gap between two movements
    is approximately 50ms longer in one than the other.
    A 50ms difference makes the difference between reporting launching and reporting two movements.

    The question was how we can get beyond intuition in understanding the verbal reports.
    I don’t think the argument offered about how to explain the conditions under which the 
    launching effect works is obvious successful.
    But I do think it’s right to ignore verbal reports in favour of an attempt to get at the
    nature of the processes that explain the launching effect.
  p How to get beyond intuition?
  p The launching effect: detecting a 50ms difference in the delay between two movements.
  .notes: :t
    Part of the answer is this.  We don't worry about the content of the verbal reports.
    We just focus on the fact that their content changes depending on a tiny, 50 millisecond
    difference in the delay between two movements.
    Call this \emph{launching effect}.
  .notes: :t
    This doesn't tell us what people are detecting.
    But it does tell us that the effect is not merely confabulation or making it up.
    So we have taken a tiny step beyond intuition.  But we also have to answer two questions.

      li.hem-around Why is a delay of up to around 70ms consistent with the launching effect occuring?
