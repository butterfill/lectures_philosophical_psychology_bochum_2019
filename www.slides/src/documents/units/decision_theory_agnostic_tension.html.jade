title: "Is Decision Theory Really Agnostic about Processes?"
tags: []
description: """
  The range of applications of decision theory 
  indicates that it must be agnostic about processes.
  But Dickinsonâ€™s instrumental process is characterised by appeal to Decision Theory.
  How can the apparent tension between these facts be resolved?

    ok, so what is this tension?

      So why does decision theory play a role in characterising
      instrumental processes?

    .notes This is like an expectation (or a belief)

      How are these combined?
      In such a way as to maximise expected utility!

    Before I resolve these tensions, I wanted to consider 
    decision theory vs game theory. Done that now.

    .notes: :t
      So how can we resolve the tensions?
      I think the key is to step back and think of Game theory as a model
