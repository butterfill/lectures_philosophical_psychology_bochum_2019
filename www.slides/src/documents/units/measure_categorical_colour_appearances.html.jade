  It is perhaps tempting to assume that claims about phenomenology
  cannot be tested scientifically.
  But this is a mistake.  We can use experiments to address the question, 
  Do things which have the property denoted by ‘red’ thereby appear to be different from things which lack it?

    An immediate problem arises from the fact that pairs of things  just one of which is \emph{red} (i.e. has the property denoted by ‘red’) differ not only in this way but also in which particular shade of colour they have.
    How can we tell whether differences in visual appearance are due in part to differences in being \emph{red} rather than entirely due to differences in shade?

+slide({bkg:'categorical_colour_difference1.jpg'})
  .notes: :t
    The problem can be overcome by introducing a third thing.  Consider constructing a sequence of three things which are indiscriminable except by colour.  Let the middle thing be \emph{red}, and let the first thing not be \emph{red}.  Now consider the difference between the particular hues of these two things.  Ensure the difference is small, but large enough that any two things which differ in hue by this amount are readily discriminable.  
    Finally, let the third thing be \emph{red}, and let the difference with respect to hue between the third and second thing be the same as the difference between the first and second thing.  (Research on colour perception shows that such differences can be equated, and that sequences of this type exist; see 
    \citealp{kuehni:2001_color} on perceptual uniformity and \citealp{witzel:2013_categorical} on categories.)  
    Consider the visual appearances of these three things.

    The difference in differences ...
  .notes: :t
    Here is the argument. Consider two sequences of sensory encounters: (a) a sequence of sensory
    encounters with two phonetic events that do not differ with respect to category (both are
    realisations of /d/, say), and (b) a sequence of sensory encounters with two phonetic events that do
    so differ (one is a realisation of /d/ the other of /g/, say).11 Let the events encountered in the
    first sequence differ from each other acoustically in the same way and by the same amount as the
    events encountered in the second sequence differ from each other. (That it is possible to find two
    such pairs of events follows from the fact that we enjoy categorical perception of speech.) The two
    sequences are depicted in Fig. 3. Now:

  .slide
    p.hem-around 4. The difference can be explained in terms of perceptual experiences as of categorical colour properties.
    .notes: :t
      The fourth step in this argument, (4), needs some filling in. How would the thesis that categorical
      perception of speech is a form of perceptual experience explain the difference in differences in
      phenomenal character? If the thesis is true, the first sequence of sensory encounters, (a), involves
      two perceptual experiences as of a single phoneme whereas the second sequence of encounters, (b),
      involves perceptual experiences as of different phonemes.12 Let us assume (not very controversially)
      that perceptual experiences have phenomenal characters and that which phenomenal character a
      perceptual experience has depends in part on what it is as of.13 It follows that differences in what
      perceptual experiences are as of can explain differences in the phenomenal characters of those
      perceptual experiences. In particular, if it is a fact that (b) involves perceptual experiences as
      of different things whereas (a) does not, this could explain why the sensory encounters in (b)
      differ in phenomenal character in a way that the sensory encounters in (a) do not.

      Difference between the two kinds of discrimination effect will be important for us later ...
    .notes: :t
      Could you object that the difference in appearance between red and non-red things
      is already built into the metric used for the colour space?  In that case you would not
      expect additional effects of categorical colour property on appearance. These effects would be
      already taken into account in the measurements of similarity.
    .notes: :t
      To answer this objection we need to note that there are multiple ways of 
      measuring perceptual similarity.
      In this case, the researchers used JNDs.
      They have previously shown that category boundaries (as specified by an individual 
      subject’s colour words) do not affect JNDs.  That is, JNDs are not generally smaller at the
      category boundaries \citep{witzel:2013_categorical}.
      But when you take pairs of colours that are, say, 3 JNDs apart, then whether or not 
      the pair straddles a category boundary will affect speed and accuracy of discimination
      \citep{witzel:2014_categorical}.
      So we can be confident that using JNDs to measure perceptual similarity does not
      take into account differences in the ways categorical colour propreties appear.

  .notes: :t
    In brief: Kay and Kempton contrasted the responses of native English 
    speakers (who have words for green and blue) with native Tarahumara (a Uto-Aztecan language of 
    northern Mexico) speakers, whose basic colour words mark no such distinction.
  .notes: :t
    Here you see a triad of colours, A, B and C.
    Kay and Kempton first measured ‘discrimination distance’.
    That is, how far apart are each of these in terms of JNDs?
    As it turns out, JNDs are not affected by which categorical colour properties you can name
    \citep{witzel:2013_categorical}.
    So we would expect discrimination distance to be approximately the same for all 
    participants. (Some studies do measure discrimination distance for
    each subject individually and find indiviudal differences; e.g. \citep{witzel:2014_categorical}).
    In this case, you can see that A is further from B in JNDs than B is from C.
  .notes: :t
    ‘discrimination distance’:
    ‘The scale of psychological distance between colors we take as the "real" scale
    for present purposes is called discrimination distance. The unit of this
    scale is the just noticeable difference (jnd), that is, the smallest physical
    difference in wavelength that can be detected by the human eye.’
    \citep[p.~68]{kay_what_1984}
    
  .notes: :t
    Next Kay and Kempton measured how visually similar their subjects judged these
    samples to be.
    To do this, they showed them different triads of colours and asked them,
    Which is the most different from the other two?
    For each pair they then computed the proportion of times that pair was split.
    (As they write: ‘The psychological distance between A and B relative to other
    stimulus pairs in the set is given by the proportion of times A and B are split
    by the subject's selection of one of them as the most different item in the
    triad.’ p. 70.)
    This is what you see from the Tarahumara speakers and the English speakers
    under the circles.
  .notes: :t
    Looking at the numbers, you can see that 
    the English speakers tended to split B and C more often than A and B, 
    whereas the Tarahumara speakers did the opposite.
  .notes: :t
    And note that the B-C pair crosses the blue-green boundary.
    What does this mean?
    ‘The presence of the blue-green lexical category boundary appears to cause
    speakers of English to exaggerate the subjective distances of colors close to
    this boundary. Tarahumara, which does not lexicalize the blue-green contrast,
    does not show this distorting effect.’
  .notes: :t
    \citep[p.~77]{kay_what_1984}:
    ‘the English speaker judges chip B to be more similar to A than to C because
    the blue-green boundary passes between B and C, even though B is perceptually
    closer to C than to A.’ 
  .notes: :t
    This is exactly the sort of evidence that should persuade us 
    that red things differ in visual appearance from non-red things.
    
  .slide
    +clip('img.bkg', 'rect(0,380px,900px,0)')
    .notes: :t
      Here’s another comparison.
      In this case, the discrimination distance (in JNDs) was the same between
      the three colour samples.
      Both groups thought that B and C are most different, and these cross
      the blue-green boundary.  But this effect was stronger in the English speakers.

          The ‘name strategy’: ‘We propose that faced with this situation the 
          English-speaking subject reasons
          unconsciously as follows: “It's hard to decide here which one looks the most
          different. Are there any other kinds of clues I might use? Aha! A and B are
          both CALLED green while C is CALLED blue. That solves my problem; I'll pick C
          as most different.” ... this cognitive strategy ... we will call the
          “name strategy”’ \citep[p.~72]{kay_what_1984}.
        .notes: :t
          ‘According to the name strategy hypothesis, the speaker who is
          confronted with a difficult task of classificatory judgment may use the lexical
          classification of the judged objects as if it were correlated with the required
          dimension of judgment even when it is not, so long as the structure of the task
          does not block this possibility’ (p. 75).

    (‘The three chips were arranged in a

    either of two pairs of the three chips, but never all three at once. For
    example, in triad (A, B, C) the pairs alternately made visible were (A, B) and
    (B, C).’) When they do this, categorical colour properties have no effects on
    perceptual judgements of similarlity. ‘Subjective similarity judgments follow
    discrimination distance and reflect no influence from lexical category
    boundaries’ (p. 73).

      How can we defend the view that red things differ in visual appearance from

      enough? (But note that \citet{witzel2014category} did find evidence for the
      effect of prototypes on judgements of similarity, so the method seems good:
      to test this, the three colour samples were arranged so that the prototype
      was positioned between a middle and an outer sample. ‘Colours close to the

    Another measure on which the green sequence differs from the blue-pink-purple sequence is pop-out, which is defined operationally in terms of visual search tasks \citep[p.\ 117]{Treisman:1986pm}.
    First I need to explain what a visual search task is.
    In visual search tasks tasks, subjects are shown an array of objects and asked to identify the one with a certain property.
    For example, one might be shown an array of twenty animal pictures and asked to identify the cat.
    Normally the time it takes subjects to find a target increases linearly as the number of objects in the array increases.
    But when the target of a visual search is defined in terms of colour and the colours of the distractors are categorically different from the colour of the target, subjects can find the target just as quickly when it is in among 36 distractors as when there are only four distractors \citep[Experiment 1]{Daoutis:2006qk}.
    This is, the colours pop out.
  .handout \textbf{pop-out} ‘Such targets pop out of the display, so that the time it takes to find them is independent of the number of distractors’ \citep[p.\ 117]{Treisman:1986pm}.
  .handout When target and distractors differ in colour category there can be pop-out effects \citep{Daoutis:2006qk}.

    Converging evidence that things labelled with different basic colour terms
    do not thereby differ in visual appearance involves a third method for
    detecting visual appearances (\citealp{webster:2012_color}). The idea, as
    illustrated in Figure \vref{fig:perceptual_grouping}, is that how things
    appear with respect to colour should influence how likely it is that they
    will be grouped together perceptually. The results are consistent with the
    view that whether objects are labelled with the same basic colour term
    makes no measurable difference to how they are grouped perceptually. This
    further supports suspicion that properties denoted by colour terms like
    ‘red’ make no difference to visual appearances (see also
    \citealp{davidoff:2012_perceptual}).
  .notes: :t
    Let’s consider the experiment in more detail.
    ‘circles at opposite diagonal corners of the square had the same color,
    while the two diagonals differed in color by a fixed angle of 30°’.
  .notes: :t
    The center circle could either be the same colour as one of the diagonals
    (as in the left and right panels),
    or it could be an inbetween colour (as in the middle panel).
    When the central colour is the same as one of the diagonals, you should perceptually
    group the diagonal as a line, like \/ or \\.
  .notes: :t
    Subjects’ task was indeed to judge which way the diagonal went.
    \citet{webster:2012_color} varied the center colour to find at what point
    a given subject was equally like to judge that the line was \/ or \\.
    Call this the ‘grouping midpoint colour’.
    (p. 378: ‘Observers made a two-alternative forced choice response to indicate
    whether the perceived orientation was clockwise or counterclockwise. A
    staircase varied the center color angle to estimate the an- gle at which
    both orientations appeared equally likely, with the point of subjective
    equality estimated from the mean of the final 10 of 13 reversals in the
    staircase.’)

    \citet{webster:2012_color} reasoned like this:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Where the two diagonals are from within the same colour category,
    the grouping midpoint colour should be the midpoint in a colour space that
    represents retinal colour discrimination.
    \item Where the two diagonals are from different colour categories (one is 
    green, the other is blue), and one of the diagonals is just over a boundary,
    then the grouping midpoint colour should be closer to the colour of the diagonal
    that is just over the boundary in a colour space that
    represents retinal colour discrimination.
    \end{enumerate}

    This prediction is illustrated in the figure.
    The dotted line shows the prediction if there is no effect of colour category
    on perceptual grouping; the solid lines show different strengths of effect.
  .notes: :t
    They found that almost no indicators of an
    effect of colour category on perceptual grouping
    (there are a variety of measures and one was signifiant: 
    p. 381: ‘the participants’ settings thus trended toward a (very weak) CP effect,
    with an average bias of 0.10 (which was nevertheless significantly differ-
    ent from zero; t (7) = 3.73, p < .01).’).
    They also suggested that these effects may be due to the use of 
    CIELAB as a colour space
    (p. 382: ‘ the small biases we found in the observer’s settings may in part
    include an artifact of the stimulus space, weakening further the evidence for a
    clear CP effect in the grouping task.’)

      While doubts might be raised about the details of one or another method, the

      appearance associated with properties denoted by colour terms like ‘red’ have
      all failed. 
    .notes: :t
      To reject this conclusion, we would have to insist that differences in
      appearance exist but influence neither judgements of perceptual similarity nor
      perceptual grouping and so are too subtle to detect. 
      This is certainly possible, but it seems wrong simply to insist that it is correct.
