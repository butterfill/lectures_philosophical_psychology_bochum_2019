  .notes  A challenge to the conjecture ...
  .notes A question was:
  p.notes.ctd.show Can humans perceive causal interactions?
  .notes: :t
    Now I think we have achieved an answer:
  p.indent.em-above.notes.show
    span Working hypothesis: Causal interactions are detected, or otherwise treated specially, by   
    span.processes perceptual processes
    span  involved in segmenting and tracking objects.

  notes: :t
    ‘participants were asked to judge whether simulated bounces of a disc against a static wedge were
    ‘‘hard’’ (like a pool ball bouncing on concrete) or ‘‘soft’’ (like a squash ball bouncing).’
    
  notes: :t
    ‘ Adaptation suggesting repeated ‘‘rigid’’ collisions resulted in more ‘‘soft’’ bounces 
    being reported, whereas adaptation suggesting repeated elastic object collisions resulted in more ‘‘hard’’ 
    bounce reports—an object elasticity aftereffect.’

    This seems hard to reconcile with object indexes.
    But (A) note the questions in the commentary; and (B) Hubbard on Kiritani (1999)
    for launching when the contact is occluded; and context effects (Scholl on postdiction)
    and (D) evidence for effects of 
    acoustic stimuli on launching, suggesting that the effect may not be modality-specific
    (The evidence on this point is controversial. Sekuler and colleagues show that when subjects observe
    an ambiguous visual display consistent with either a collision or a passing event, the timing of a
    tone can control whether subjects report seeing a collision or pass- ing, and argue that this is a
    multisensory phenomenon: R. Sekuler et al., ‘Sound Alters Visual Motion Perception’, Nature, 
    (), p. . Watanabe and Shimojo extend this finding by showing that not any event (or
    non-event) which draws attention at the moment of a collision will disambiguate the display; they
    argue that the tone’s effect on the perception of a col- lision is a ‘genuine audiovisual effect,
    not an audiovisual effect that results from auditory effects’: K. Watanabe and S. Shimojo, ‘When
    Sound Affects Vision: Effects of Auditory Grouping on Visual Motion Perception’, Psychological
    Science,  (), pp. –. Guski and Troje, on the other hand, show that features which carry
    no information about causation, such as a blink, can also influence whether subjects report seeing a
    collision or a passing. These authors conclude that auditory influences on the perceptual of
    collisions are ‘no true cross-modal phenomenon’: R. Guski and N.F. Troje, ‘Audiovisual Phenomenal
    Causality’, Perception and Psychophysics,  (), pp. –, at p. .)
