    First, think about the methods philosophers use.
    Am I missing any?
  .notes: :t
    Next, think about how philosophers construct theories of action ...


+slide({bkg:'folk_psychology_roots/Slide1.jpg'})
  .notes: :t
    Here’s Ayesha and she’s about to act, which involves some kind of 
    processes occurring in her imnd.
    
+slide({bkg:'folk_psychology_roots/Slide2.jpg'})
  .notes: :t
    Ben want’s to predict Ayesha’s action, perhaps so he can coordinate his actions
    around hers. He is therefore having a think about what Ayesha might be up to.
  .notes: :t
    Implicit in Ben’s thinking is a model of actions.

+slide({bkg:'folk_psychology_roots/Slide3.jpg'})
  .notes: :t
    And along comes the philosopher and attempts to guess what is going on in
    Ben’s mind when he is thinking about Ayesha.
    The philosopher asks, in effect, What model of actions is implicit in Ben’s thinking?
  .notes: :t
    And this, essentially, is the raw material for philosophical theories of actions.

    Focus on Ben for a moment.

      .notes: :t
        What mundane purposes does thinking about actions serve?
        Prediction and coordination; ethical (assigning responsibility, blame; living together); 
        normative (he wants himself and others to live it out as much as to describe how things are;
        there may also be something about ‘understanding’ here).
        So it’s not all about accuracy; in fact, of these, only prediction and coordination even
        potentially requires that his model of actions is accurate.
      .bens-model
        p Functions of Ben’s model of minds and actions:
        ul.hem-around-children
          li.ethical ethical
          li.normative normative
          li.predictive predictive

              +blur('.ethical, .normative')
              .notes: :t
                Second, consider Ben’s concern with making predictions.
            .slide
              p.indent --- speed vs accuracy
                .notes: :t
                  Whenever you are making predictions about anything at all, you face a 
                  \textbf{trade-off between accuracy and speed}.
                  Making more accurate predictions requires considering more information and integrating
                  it in a more complex model of minds and actions.
                  By contrast, making faster predictions requires narrowing the information you consider
                  and using a less complex model of minds and actions.
                  Since Ben often has to make predictions fast enough to actually coordinate his actions
                  with Ayesha’s, and since making predictions consumes scarce 
                  cognitive resources, Ben is usually needs to trade accuracy for speed.
                .notes: :t
                  So Ben’s model of minds and actions is not built for accuracy.
    .slide
      +hide('.bens-model')
      .notes: :t
        So this is the model of minds and actions on which many philosophical theories
        are based ... they are cast as attempts to characterise this model.

  p Relying on philosophers to characterise actions

    span would be like 
    br
    span relying on Aristotelians to characterise physical objects.
  .notes: :t
    In the case of physical objects, I suppose few people seriously think 
    there is much we can understand without appeal to physics.
  .notes: :t
    As Newton stressed, contemporary philosophical methods are not well suited to the task.
    Contemporary philosophical methods are of limited use in making discoveries about the world.

  p Looking ahead ...
  p.em-above Godfrey-Smith contrasts models with theories,
    br
    span and suggests that philosophers are often 
    br
    span best seen as constructing models rather than theories.
