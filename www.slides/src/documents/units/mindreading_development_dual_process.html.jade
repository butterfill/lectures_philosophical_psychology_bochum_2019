  Formally, minimal theory of mind is in principle sufficient to enable success on 
  standard false belief location tasks. 
  There is also some evidence that infants’ mindreading is based on a model of minds and actions
  specified by minimal theory of mind.
  If this is true, 
  why do infants manifest abilities to track beliefs in some cases but not all?

  .notes: :t
    So far I’ve been characterising a dual process theory of mindreading which, like 
    dual process theories of memory and reasoning, focusses on adults.
    But of course most of the excitement concerns questions about development.

    Why is there an age at which children pass some false belief tasks but systematically fail
    others? What feature or features distinguish the tasks these children fail from those they
    pass?
  .notes: :t
    When you compare different types of response to a single scenario,
    why do you find that there is an interaction of age and performance?

    Conjecture:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Automatic and nonautomatic mindreading processes both occur from the first year of life onwards.
    \item The model of minds and actions underpinning automatic mindreading process does not
    significantly change over development.
    \item In the first three or four years of life, nonautomatic mindreading processes involve
    relatively crude models of minds and actions, models which do not enable belief tracking.
    \item What changes over development is typically just that the model underpinning nonautomatic
    mindreading becomes gradually more sophisticated and eventually comes to enable belief tracking.
    \end{enumerate}

    By contrast, the model of minds and actions underpinning nonautomatic mindreading process
    does significantly change over development.
    In the first three or four years of life, nonautomatic mindreading processes involve
    relatively crude models of minds and actions, models which do not enable belief tracking.
    What changes over development is typically just that the model underpinning nonautomatic
    mindreading becomes gradually more sophisticated and eventually comes to enable belief
    tracking.

      There is evidence for this from a number of studies.
    .notes: :t
      There is a pattern of no change across development when you consider 
      responses like looking time and anticipatory looking which tend to reflect
      automatic mindreading (although they do not always do so) 
    .notes: :t
      But when you consider responses like verbal predictions, which tend to reflect
      nonautomatic mindreading, you see improvements over development.

    Signature limits are important in two ways.
    First, they generate predictions.
    And second, they allow us to test hypotheses linking particular kinds of mindreading
    process across developmental time.

    One important feature of these and other findings is that you get the same
    signature limits in adults and infants.
