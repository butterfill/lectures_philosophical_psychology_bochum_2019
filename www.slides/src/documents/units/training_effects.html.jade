    This is from a different study than the one I will emphasise:
    in this study they only demonstrate instrumental behaviour in young children.

    p Subjects: 3-4 year olds
    p.slide Training:
    p.slide.indent Choice Group : perform Action1 to see Clip1 or Action2 to see Clip2
    p.slide.indent Single-Action Group : only one action is available at once
    p.slide.indent (Frequency of Action1 and Action2 is matched across groups!)
  p.slide Devalue Clip1 (expose to satiety) 
  p.slide Test: both actions available. What do Ss select?
  .slide 
    p Results: 
    p.indent.r1 Choice group selects Action2
    p.indent.r2 Single-Action Group selects Action1 and Action2 equally

      ‘We argued that the variation in the development of behavioral autonomy arose from the different contingency experienced of the two groups. Once responding at a high and constant rate in the single-action condition after extended training, agents no longer experience the full causal contingency, speci cally episodes in which they do not respond and do not receive the outcome. As a result, the action-outcome causal representation necessary for goal-directed action is not maintained.’
