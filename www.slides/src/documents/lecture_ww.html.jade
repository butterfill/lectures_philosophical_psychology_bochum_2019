  .notes: :t
    So far I’ve argued that we need a theory of radical interpretation
    in order to understand social cognition because a theory of radical
    interpretation provides a computational description of social cognition.
  .notes: :t
    Now I want to argue that there is a problem: 
    we don't have an adequate theory of radical interpretation.
    There are actually two main theories of radical interpretaion,
    Davidson’s and Dennett’s, so strictly I should offer objections to 
    both.  But here I’ll just consider Dennett’s theory.

  Interaction: your-goal-is-my-goal
    
  Claim: interaction in mindreading enables us to overcome problem of opaque means
  without insight into beliefs or other mental states, so potentially provides a foundation
  for understand these things.
  
  Claim: interaction in mindreading enables us to act as if we understand referential 
  communication, so provides the basis for the beginning of referential communication.

  p.huge-glow conclusion 3
  .notes.show
    p.center Interaction makes available routes to knowledge of the goals of actions.
  .notes.handout: :t
    Simple forms of interaction enable correct goal ascription in
    situations where it would not otherwise be possible.
    So if we are giving a computational description of 
    social cognition, we must consider the interpreter as not merely
    observing her target but also potentially interacting with her.
  .notes: :t
    I also want to make an observation which leads to a conjecture.
    Simple forms of interaction simultaneously give rise to a
    need to identify false beliefs and a means of distinguishing 
    actions that are guided by such beliefs.
    This suggests a conjecture: the ability to track false beliefs may be a
    consequence of the ability to engage in simple forms of social interaction.

      .notes: :t
        This leaves open many outstanding questions.
      .notes: :t
        Are there further ways in which interaction matters in radical
        interpretation? (Or is it merely a facilitator?)
      .notes: :t
        How does the theory sketched here contribute to problems of radical interpretation?
        --- E.g. Indeterminacy resolved?
      .notes: :t
        ISSUE: Is there a deep theoretical 
        obstacle to specifying canonical theory of mind?  Davidson’s
        claims about normativity (norms of the observer ...)?
