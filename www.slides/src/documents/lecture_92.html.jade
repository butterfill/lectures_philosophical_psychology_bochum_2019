  AFTER : OBJECTIONS
  
  Objection 1:
    Hernik and Southgate 2012 - Nine-months-old infants do not need to know what the agent prefers
    in order to 
    even the original jumping study goes against subtlety
    
  
  make claw agentive do get results [Sam]
    (a) Luo and Baillargeon 2005?
    (b) Biro and Leslie, 2007?
    
  Mi Hernik:
    (a) It's not that goal-tracking is LIMITED by motor abilities; it's that they FACILITATE goal-tracking!
    
  Skerry, Carey & Spelke
    3mnth olds PNAS recent sticky mittens
    nb something gets stuck to the mittents; it's not really grasping!
    No possible way that the training gives them experience of efficient goal-directed actions
    PROBLEM FOR ME BECAUSE They shouldn't appreciate the efficiency of the two routes to the 
    object (they can't reach overhand to the object)!
    Most likely the infants realise that contact is a candidate for a goal-directed action.
    


//- 
  IMPROVEMENTS 
    (a) Introduce Marr’s levels of description
    (b) cover Skerry, Carey & Spelke [nb: this is an issue if Infants can’t reach overhand]

  OUTLINE
  
  0. Goal tracking is ...
  
  1. Infants can track [nb: not ‘identify’] goals from around six months of age. (e.g. Woodward; Ambrosini et al) -- variety of paradigms and measures (violation-of-expectations, anticipatory looking)
  
  2. Q1 How do they do this?
  
  3. Teleological stance. [Just present it my way, as a computational description of pure goal tracking]
  
  4. How is this implemented? By reasoning. Relation to Q3: no special system; relation to Q6: teleological stance is continuous with mindreading (the latter merely involves using an enriched model with includes mental states; the two can be parts of a single process).
  
  5. But goal-tracking is limited: own-action constraint
  
  6. Q2 In infants and adults, abilities to perform actions enable identifying goals when observing them: Why?
  
  7. Motor theory of goal tracking (mTgt).
  
  8. Marr’s levels: mTgt is not an alternative to the Teleological Stance but to it plus the claim about reasoning. 
  
  9. Importantly, mTgt explains aspects of *adult’s* performance as well as infants.  
  
  10. This supports a dual-process theory.
  
  11. But: infants’ abilities are (i) not invariably limited in ways that mTgt predicts (cartoon fish,
      etc); and (ii) limited in ways that mTgt does not predict (dissociations)
  
  12. This then is the Developmental Puzzle: there appears to be evidence against
  both mTgt and Csibra’s view. This makes Q1 hard to answer (How do six month olds track goals?) and so supports the view that the question is a puzzle.
  
  13. Perceptual animacy is the answer?
  





.handout: :t
  \emph{The Simple View}
  The principles comprising the Teleological Stance are things infants know or believe, and infants are
  able to track goals by making inferences from these principles plus their beliefs about the means
  agents have selected.

  .notes: :t
    I seize little Isabel and swing her around, thereby making her laugh and 
    breaking a vase.
    Asked about this I might say, ‘The goal of my actions was not to break the vase
    but only to make her laugh, of course.’
    In talking about goals in this way I am not talking about mental representations:
    I am talking about actual and possible outcomes of an action, things which did or might 
    have happened.
  .notes: :t
    A goal is an outcome to which an outcome is directed.

    .notes: :t
      For a process to track a goal of an action is for how that process unfolds to nonaccidentally
      depend in some way on whether that outcome is indeed a goal of the action.

      In this lecture I propose to introduce a developmental puzzle about goal tracking.
      Along the way I will also introduce some theories of goal-tracking, none of which 
      seems entirely adequate to the evidence.

    .notes: :t
      One last thing before I start: my focus is pure goal-tracking, that is, goal-tracking which
      does not depend on any information about mental states.
    .notes: :t
      I take pure goal-tracking to be a fundamental capacity, one which anchors abilities to 
      understand others’ minds and underpins capacities to perform joint actions.
      [Because it underpins our abilities to identify mental states and to generate predictions based on
      ascriptions of mental states.]

  p.huge-glow-120.center Conclusion
  .notes: :t
     My question was, How can infants in the first 9 months of life track goals?
     Given that infants’ goal-tracking is limited by their abilities to perform actions,
     I proposed to answer this question by appeal to the mTgt:
     Infants’ pure goal-tracking, like much of adults’, depends on the double life of motor processes.
  .notes: :t
     This yielded a simple dual-process theory of goal-tracking.
  .notes: :t
     But this is much too simple, as
     findings on infants’ goal-tracking in the first 9 months of life confronts us with a puzzle.
     For they appear to show that, in many cases, infants can track the goals of actions 
     performed by cartoon fish and spheres; and these are clearly actions that no infant (or adult)
     could perform.
  .notes: :t
     Apparantly, then, we must reject the mTgt. But if we do that, it seems we lack any way of 
     explaining why infants’ goal-tracking is so often limited by their abilities to act.
  .notes: :t
     The solution, I suggested, is to invoke perceptual animacy.
     That is what led me to this conjecture ...

      p Conjecture
      p.em-above: :t
        In 9-month-olds, 
      p.hem-above: :t
        all pure goal-tracking is explained by the Motor Theory;
      p.hem-above: :t
        appearances that goal-tracking is not limited by their abilities to act
        are due to perceptual animacy.     
  .notes: :t
    This conjecture is quite bold, but I think it’s one worth betting on partly because,
    as I suggested, it generates readily testable predictions.
  .notes: :t
    This conjecture also has another virtue.
    Goal-tracking is so fundamental to social cognition and joint action that it is 
    likely to depend on a rich mix of many kinds of processes, including associative learning.
    We need ways to identify these processes, to distinguish their limits and to understand their 
    synergies.
    Distinguishing motor processes which support goal-tracking by realising the Teleological Stance 
    from perceptual animacy is a step towards meeting this need.
  
  .notes: :t
    So how does this bear on the conference topic,
    Action Perception?
    In short, there isn’t any.
    At least not if actions are goal-directed actions.
  .notes: :t
    Why do I say this?  Not because I can rule out the possibility of action perception, of course.
    But goal-tracking is like speech perception in this sense: in both cases, the best supported,
    most carefully developed theories are not about perceptual processes but about motor processes.

  .notes: :t
    That, anyway, is my conclusion.
    The double life of motor processes underpins humans’ earliest 
    pure goal-tracking, and so provides a basis for the many and varied forms of social cognition,
    including mindreading, which depend on pure goal-tracking.
  .notes: :t
    Many will disagree with this.
    What I hope we will agree about, though, is that solving the developmental puzzle
    about pure-goal tracking is essential if we care at all about the abilities
    which underpin humans’ capacities for social cognition and joint action.
