    Recall what a Dual Process Theory of Mindreading claims.
    The core claim is just this:

    +fade('img.bkg')
    p.handout.notes.show: :t
      Two (or more) mindreading processes are distinct: the conditions which
      influence whether they occur, and which outputs they generate, do not 
      completely overlap.

  .notes: :t
    To generate readily testable predictions, we need to go beyond the schematic 
    part of a dual process theory, the part which is common to 
    dual process theories of memory and of physical cognition.
    We were focussed on mindreading in the last lecture;
    but before that we also considered what are actually dual process theories of 
    object cognition and goal tracking.
  .notes: :t
    In each domain,
    we generate further predictions by filling in the 
    the domain-specific parts of the dual process theory.

      Before going further,

      to say a little more in defence of the dual-process theory of mindreading 
      and explain how it answers the Three Questions about mindreading ...

    We have to go from the dual process schema to add claims about the 
    nature of the processes. It’s these claims that give us a theory *of mindreading*.

  .notes: :t
    Earlier I suggested that
    (a) a dual process theory can help to explain an apparently anomalous pattern of 
    developmental findings, and that (b) by linking infants’ and 
    adults’ performance, it generates testable predictions.
  .notes: :t
    [repeat] In essence, the idea is this.  If the processes dominating R1 and R2 are different,
    the different relations between age and performance these responses reveal simply indicate
    that the two processes develop differently.
  .notes: :t
    The process or processes dominating R1 changes relatively little over development, while the
    process dominating R2 undergoes gradual change over months or years.

        p.center.huge-glow challenge
      .notes: :t
        Accepting a dual process theory complicates answering the question we really want
        answered about the emergence of knowledge in development.
      .notes: :t
        [Notes are a bit messy in what follows: originally had three challenges, decided
        to simplify by collapsing the first two; then realised would make more sense just
        to introduce the first challenge (and then talk about the third challenge after 
        (partially) solving the first).]
      .notes: :t
        If we do accept a dual process theory in any domain, we are immediately confronted by
        three questions.
        \begin{enumerate}
        \item What is the link between the early-developing processes and the looking-time responses?
        [Why is a relatively autoamtic process not only influencing attention and motor actions but also
        causing a ‘stop and think’ reaction?]
        \item What, if anything, ensures that the processes ever nonaccidentally provide matching answers? [synchronic]
        \item How do processes which are relatively unchanging over development influence the 
        emergence, in development, of knowledge of simple facts about particular things? [diachronic]
        \end{enumerate}

  .notes: :t
    First challenge ... why is the early-developing process having effects on things
    like looking times in habituation and violtion-of-expectation experiments but not
    influencing things like verbal judgements and the final selection of an answer expressed
    by selecting a key or a picture?
  .notes: :t
    This is a particularly tricky question when the infant or child is responding at chance on
    an explicit measure like giving verbal judgements. Why is the implicit process not affecting
    these judgements (or if it is, how is it doing so)?
  .notes: :t
    How if at all does the early-developing process influence verbal judgements in adults?
    Do the processes have entirely independent effects on behaviour, or is there some kind
    of interface?  If there’s an interface, how does this interface change over development?

        So my question was how the early developing process might

        violation-of-expectation experiments.
        My guess is that some operations of object indexes give rise to
        metacognitive feelings, which in turn influence looking durations.

        The second function they play is to inform judgements, as when they cause you
        to judge that something is familiar, or surprising, or done by you. 
        Their playing this second function depends on learnt associations between metacognitive 
        feeling, contextual features and interpretations (e.g. surprise, agency, whatever).
      .notes: :t
        [It doesn’t matter whether there are several distinct feelings or one (e.g. 
        surprise and agency may or may not be distinct feelings). As long as they reliably occur in 
        sufficiently different contexts and as long as associations can be formed between the 
        feelings, the contexts and the interpretations, the judgements will be secured.]
      .notes: :t
        [Dokic rejects the 'water diviner' model because he recognises, correctly, that it cannot
        explain how metacognitive feelings could play this second function. But whereas he suggests
        that they have intentional contents in virtue of which they play it, I think that 
        associations suffice.]

      .notes: :t
        It’s the need for learnt associations to get from metacognitive feelings to judgements which
        explains why the early-developing process can guide judgements in adults and older children
        but not infants.  
        This also explains why the early-developing process and the learnt judgements can come
        apart in adults: judgements do not depend entirely on metacognitive feelings; they can
        occur in their absence, and can override them on occasion.
