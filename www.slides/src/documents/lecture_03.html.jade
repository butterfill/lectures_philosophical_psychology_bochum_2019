//- 
  In 2016/7 this whole lecture ended up being mostly a long discussion.
  I barely got as far as introducing the problems.
  So lecture 04 is also dedicated to this topic.
  But in another year you might want to cover this in a single lecture.


+title_slide({document:document, images:images})
  .notes: :t
    I want to start by recalling some issues from the first two lectures.
    Today I will attempt to tie these together, then, next week, we will move
    on to a different set of issues.
    (Perhaps colour?)

    Next I want to build on what we did in lecture 2 and argue that there is a further
    puzzle.
    The further puzzle concerns how motor representation may influence judgements about 
    the goals of actions.
  .notes: :t
    To see how the puzzle arises, I want to go back and reconsider the double life of 
    motor representations. This is something I’ve already mentioned twice; now I want
    to fill in some details that make it even more puzzling.

  p.hem-around In action observation, motor representations of outcomes 
  p.hem-around.step3.hide sometimes facilitate the identification of goals in thought.

    p.em-above So
    p: :t
      where motor representations influence a thought about an action being directed to a
      particular outcome, there is normally a motor representation of this outcome, or of a
      matching outcome.
    .notes: :t
      This conclusion entails that motor representations have content-respecting
      influences on thoughts. It is the fact that one outcome rather than another is represented
      motorically which explains, at least in part, why the observer takes this outcome (or a matching
      one) to be an outcome to which the observed action is directed.
  .slide
    p.em-above But
    p how could motor representations have content-respecting influences on thoughts 
      span.step4.hide given their inferential isolation
      span ?
    .notes: :t
      But how could motor representations
      have content-respecting influences on thoughts? One familiar way to explain content-respecting
      influences is to appeal to inferential relations. To illustrate, it is no mystery that your beliefs
      have content-respecting influences on your intentions, for the two are connected by processes of
      practical reasoning. But motor representation, unlike belief and intention, does not feature in
      practical reasoning. Indeed, thought is inferentially isolated from it. How then could any motor
      representations have content-respecting influences on thoughts?

//-   .notes: :t
//-     In conclusion,
//-     the interface problem is the problem of explaining how there could be nonaccidental matches
//-     between motor representations and intentions.
//-   .notes: :t
//-     The interface problem is complicated by the \textbf{anatomy} of outcomes, the varying \textbf{scales}
//-     at which intentions can specify actions, and by the possibility of nonaccidental \textbf{dynamical}
//-     matching.
//-   .notes: :t
//-     Part (but not all) of the solution to the interface problem may be what I provisionally called
//-     the ‘action index’ conjecture.
//-     According to this conjecture,

//-     +actionIndexConjecture({final:true})
//-   .notes: :t
//-     I’m yet fully convinced that this ‘action index’ conjecture is the right way to think about
//-     action experiences.  But what I am convinced of is that if we are going to solve the interface
//-     problem, we will need to understand the ways in which actions can be experienced and the mechanisms
//-     which make this possible.
