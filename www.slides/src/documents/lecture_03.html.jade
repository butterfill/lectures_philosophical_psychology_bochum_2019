abstract: """
  How could we come to know that another is angry about an insult or happy about an outcome?  
  Some philosophers have defended the hypothesis that knowledge of others' anger or joy is 
  sometimes perceptual (e.g. Smith, 2010, 2015; McNeill, 2012a,b).  In this talk I consider 
  two challenges to this hypothesis.  The first challenge is to identify evidence in favour 
  of it, or at least to explain what evidence could bear on the hypothesis.  Perhaps this 
  challenge can be met by considering categorical perception of expressions of emotion, 
  for which there is some evidence. The second challenge is to specify a model of anger 
  and other mental states which captures how these mental states appear to the perceivers.  
  This is a hard challenge to meet because available models arguably render mental states 
  imperceptible.  In the last part of the talk I propose an alternative way in which knowledge 
  of others' mental states could be acquired, one that hinges on interaction rather than 
  perception.  Reflection on what is involved in sharing a smile suggests that one route to 
  knowledge of others’ mental states might involve interacting with them.

    subtitle is:
    Prospects for the Hypothesis That We Perceive Mental States, 
    and How Some Limits on What Can Be Perceived Are Overcome through Simple Forms of Social Interaction.
  .notes: :t
    This talk is about a simple question.
    Do humans every perceptually expeirence any of another’s mental states?
    What evidence would help us to answer this question?
    At the very end, I will switch from perception to interaction,
    and consider what we might gain by
    shifting from merely observing expressions of emotion to 
    jointly expressing an emotion as in sharing a smile.

      Where ‘it’ is an ordinary physical object like my favourite pen,
      each of these three identifies a process by which knowledge could be acquired.

      (This is not to say that talk about reasoning invariably picks out a process (cf Alvarez),
      just that there is a process.)
    .notes: :t
      There seems to be a clear contrast the first and last ways of coming to know about it.
      (Philosophers debate about whether the first and second are genuinely different routes 
      to knowledge.)

      Even if, as do I, you think perception involves inference-like processes, there is still
      a contrast between inferring and perceiving.
    .notes: :t
      For instance, suppose you know that I am all but inseparable from my favourite pen.
      Then when you see me arrive you can infer that my pen is here too.
      Contrast this with simply seeing my pen on the table.
      In one case we see something other than the pen, namely me, and inferring that the
      pen is here; in the other case you are seeing the pen itself.

    [not relevant yet:] ‘(3) a losing face on a winning body’
  .notes: :t
    Emotions are sometimes expressed bodily and vocally.
    Here is someone who has just won or lost a tennis match, so is feeling
    joy or anger.  Maybe you can tell which?
  .notes: :t
    Here is a natural thought:
    Bodily and vocal expressions of emotion
    enable us to perceptually experience the expressed emotions.
  .notes: :t
    This natural thought fits with ordinary talk about mental states.
    Imagine yourself at a tennis match.
    Reporting the event afterwards, you might say that you saw his ecstacy
    at winning.
    It might seem that his ecstacy is as plainly visible as the hair on his head.

  .notes: :t
    There are scientists and philosophers who have placed a lot of weight 
    on verbal reports.
    They are satisfied that if people use mental state terms to describe what they
    perceive, then they perceive those mental states.
    But I think this can’t be right.
  .notes: :t
    Go back to the tennis match.
    Reporting the event afterwards you might say not only that you saw his ecstacy 
    but also that you saw him win.
    I take it you can't literally perceptually experience winning or losing 
    in the sense that, arguably, you can perceptually experience movement or changes in colour.
    After all, winning or loosing is a matter of rules and conventions.
  .slide

    .notes: :t
      So we can’t straightforwardly take what people say as a guide to what they perceive.
    .notes: :t
      Here you might object that we can perceptually experience things like winning or losing,
      so there is no reason to question verbal reports.
    .notes: :t
      But note that taking this line amounts to rejecting the claim I started with.

    .notes: :t
      I claimed that there is a contrast between seeing an indicator and inferrring the
      presence of an object 
    .notes: :t
      If there is a contrast here, what we colloquially call seeing someone win must be 
      a case of perceiving indicators and inferring winning.
      So to say that we can straightforwardly infer that people perceive emotions from
      their verbal reports is to reject the existence of the very contrast that allows
      us to make sense of the question.

    Part of the evidence relevant to the perceptual hypothesis is evidence that 
    humans can categorically perceive expressions of emotion.
  .notes: :t
    Then my next question was,
    What does the evidence from studies of categorical perception
    tell us about the truth or falsity of the perceptual hypothesis ?
  .slide
    +invert('.cp')
    .notes: :t
      Now I think we can answer this question.
      Or rather, we know that the answer depends on what the objects of categorical perception are.
    .notes: :t
      If the objects of categorical perception are merely facial expresssions,
      then I think the evidence does not support the claim that we see aspects of
      each others’ mental lives.
    .notes: :t
      But if, as I’ve conjectured, the objects of categorical perception are 
      actions directed to the expression of particular emotions, then I think the 
      evidence does provide modest support for the claim that we perceive aspects
      of each others’ mental lives.
    .notes: :t
      This claim will need qualifying in various ways.
  .slide
    +highlight('.see', 'red')
    .notes: :t
      First, the evidence suggests that categorical perception of expressions of emotion,
      like categorical perception of speech, is not tied to single modality in any very
      robust way.
    .notes: :t
      Second, I suggest elsewhere that categorical perception isn’t exactly like 
      perception as philosophers standardly understand it.
      In particular, its phenomenology is to be understood in terms of 
      \textbf{PHENOMENAL EXPECTATIONS} rather than by analogy with perception of shapes or textures.

    .notes: :t
      But let me put these aside because I want to mention a second challenge.

      The challenge is to specify a model of anger and other mental states which captures how these
      mental states appear to the perceivers. This is a hard challenge to meet because available models
      arguably render mental states imperceptible.
    .notes: :t
      But what is a model of the emotions?
      Since emotions are mental states, here I think we can step back and think about mental states generally.
      On a widely accepted view, mental states involve subjects having  attitudes toward contents (see figure).
      Possible attitudes include believing, wanting, being happy that, and being angry that. 
      The content is what distinguishes one belief from all others, or one desire from all others.
      The content is also what determines whether a belief is true or false, and whether a desire is satisfied or unsatisfied.

      There are two main tasks in constructing a model of mental states. 
      The first task is to characterise some attitudes.
      This typically involves specifying their distinctive functional and normative roles.%
      \footnote{
      For examples, see \citet{Bratman:1987xw} on intention or \citet[][chapter 11]{Velleman:2000fq} on belief.
      }
      %
      The second task is to find a scheme for specifying the contents of mental states.
      This typically involves one or another kind of proposition, although some  have suggested other abstract entities including map-like representations.%
      \footnote{
      See \citet[p.\ 163]{Braddon-Mitchell:1996ce}: ‘what is inside our heads should be thought of as more like maps than sentences.’
      }
    .notes.handout: :t
      ‘emotions are episodic modes of evaluative engagement with the social and practical world’
      \citep[p.\ 1512]{parkinson:2008_emotions}.
    .notes: :t
      FIRST LIMIT:
      Determinate emotions (the particular evaluation implied by my anger in this case)
      vs the determinable (anger, in this case).  Categorical perception provides evidence 
      only for the determinable. (Joel said in discussion that he made this point
      with an analogy with CP of colour in Smith (2010)).
    .notes: :t
      SECOND LIMIT:
      Static emotions vs emotions unfolding (see notes below from ‘sharing a smile’).
      It seems that CP doesn’t capture dynamics of emotion.
    .notes: :t
      So only a very crude model of the mental would capture emotions as we
      categorically perceive them.
      What we need here is a minimal theory of the emotions.

  p.right.grey-text McNeill (2012, p. 573)
  .notes: :t
    Focussing on emotions like joy, I have suggested that 
    we face two challenges (at least) in answering it.
  
  p.em-above challenge 1: evidence?
  .notes: :t
    The first challenge is to explain what kind of evidence might
    bear on the question.
  .notes: :t
    Here I suggested that studies of categorical perception of expressions of emotion
    are relevant.
    Whether they provide evidence in favour fo the view that we can know others’ mental
    states through perceiving them depends on what  the objects of categorical perception
    are.
  .notes: :t
    If they are facial configurations, or something like this, then it seems clear that
    the evidence does not support the view  that we can know others’ mental
    states through perceiving them.
    If anything, such evidence would support the view that when we think we are perceiving
    mental states, we are actually perceiving facial expressions that we associate with
    particular emotions.
  .notes: :t
    But if the objects of categorical perception are actions directed to the goal of expressing
    particular emotions, then studies of categorical perception do provide some evidence
    for the view that we have at least phenomenal expectations concerning others’ emotions.
    
  p.em-above challenge 2: Which model of the emotions?
  .notes: :t
    The second challenge concerned the limits of categorical perception.
  .notes: :t
    I suggested that because categorical perception is underpinned by automatic processes 
    which operate over a short temporal window, the emotions which are the goals of the 
    actions that are the objects of categorical perception cannot be modelled as propositional
    attitudes.
    Instead we need a more minimal model of the mental to understand the nature of these
    emotions.
  p.em-above challenge 3: Relation to speech and action?
    
  .notes: :t
    In the end, we are probably not yet in a position to know whether humans ever perceptually experience others' mental states.
    But thinking about categorical perception does give us a way of finally making some
    progress with this question.
