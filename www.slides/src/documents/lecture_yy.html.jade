abstract: """
  Acting together with a purpose is a familiar feature of everyday life. People
  play duets, move pianos together, and drink toasts together. In such cases
  the actions people perform have a collective goal in at least this sense:
  they are directed to an outcome and this is not, or not only, a matter of
  each action being individually directed to this outcome. But in virtue of
  what do the actions people perform in acting together have collective goals?
  In considering a counterpart of this question concerning acting alone with a
  purpose, several philosophers have argued that it is necessary to identify a
  role for motor representations. By contrast, philosophical discussions of
  acting together have mainly ignored motor representation. They have also have
  neglected very small scale cases of acting together with a purpose such as
  two pianists playing a chord together, two people elevating a piano together,
  or two people clinking glasses. In this seminar I introduce a proposal to
  fill both gaps. The strategy is to generalise a view about goals and motor
  representations in acting alone with a purpose. The conclusion is that some
  cases of acting together with a purpose constitutively involve motor
  representations. This may have implications for understanding the varieties
  of ways in which people can act together.

    In this lecture, I will outline a minimal framework for theorising
    about joint action. 
    I will also argue that attention to the role of 
    motor representation in coordinating joint action
    proves unexpectedly helpful in enabling us to understand 
    the sophisticated sort of cooperative interactions that are often
    the focus of philosophical discussions of joint action.

    from parallel but merely individual action?

  p distributive vs collective
  p.hem-around.indent.injections ‘The injections saved her life.’
  .notes: :t
    Consider the statement, ‘The injections saved her life.’  
    This could be true in virtue of her receiving several injections on different occasions, each of
    which saved her life.
    In this case, the injections saving her life is just a matter of each injection individually
    saving her life; this is the distributive interpretation.
    But the statement is also true if she was given two injections on a single occasion where each
    injection was necessary but not sufficient to save her life.
    In this case the injections saving her life is not, or not just, a matter of each injection
    individually saving her life; this is the collective interpretation.
  .notes: :t
    The difference between distributive and collective interpretations is clearly substantial, for on
    the distributive interpretation the statement can only be true if her life has been saved more
    than once, whereas the truth of the collective interpretation requires only one life-threatening
    situation.
      
  .slide

    .notes: :t
      Just as some injections can be collectively life-saving, so some actions can be collectively
      directed to a goal.
      For example, consider this sentence:
    p.hem-around.indent.notes.show ‘The 
      span.goal goal
      span  of their actions is to find a new home.’
    .notes: :t
      This can be interpreted distributively: each of their actions is separately
      directed to finding a new home.
      But it can also be interpreted collectively: finding a home is an outcome to which
      their actions are directed and this is not, or not just, a matter of each of their actions being
      individually directed to finding a home.
  .slide
    +invert('.goal')
    .notes: :t
      To say that an outcome is a \emph{collective goal} of some actions is just to say that
      it is an outcome to which the actions are directed and this is not, or not just, a matter of
      each action being individually directed to that outcome.

    .notes: :t
      Note that collective goals do not plausibly require any kind of intentions or commitments.
      After all,
      there is a sense in which some of the actions of swarming bees are directed to finding a nest
      and this is not, or not just, a matter of each bee’s actions being individually directed to
      finding a nest. So finding a nest is a collective goal of the bees’ actions.

    .notes: :t
      As what Ayesha and Beatrice are doing---filling a glass together---is a paradigm case of joint action, it might seem natural to answer the question by invoking a notion of shared (or `collective') intention.
      Suppose Ayesha and Beatrice have a shared intention that they fill the glass.
      Then, on many accounts of shared intention,
  .slide
    +show('.represents')
    .notes: :t
      the shared intention involves each of them intending that they, Ayesha and Beatrice, fill the glass; 
      or each of them being in some other state which picks out this outcome. 
  .slide
    +show('.coordinates')
    .notes: :t
      The shared intention also provides for the coordination of their actions (so that, for example, 
      Beatrice doesn't start pouring until Ayesha is holding the glass under the bottle).  And 
      coordination of this type would normally facilitate occurrences of the type of outcome intended. 
      In this way, invoking a notion of shared intention provides one answer to our question about what 
      it is for some actions to be collectively directed to an outcome.
  .slide
    +show('.iasmr')
    .notes: :t
      Are there also ways of answering the question which involve psychological structures other than shared intention? In this paper we shall draw on recent discoveries about how multiple agents coordinate their actions to argue that the collective directedness of some actions to an outcome can be explained in terms of a particular interagential structure of motor representations.  
      Our actions having collective goals is not always only a matter of what we intend: sometimes it constitutively involves motor representation.

    Consider this case.
    An agent fills a glass by holding it in one hand, holding the bottle in the other,
    bringing the two together and pouring from the bottle into the glass.

  .notes: :t
    It’s a familiar idea that motor representations of outcomes resemble intentions in that they can 
    trigger processes which are like planning in some respects. 
    These processes are like planning in that they involve starting with representations of relatively 
    distal outcomes and gradually filling in details, resulting in a structure of motor representations 
    that can be hierarchically arranged by the means-end relation \citep{bekkering:2000_imitation,
    grafton:2007_evidence}. 
    Processes triggered by motor representations of outcomes are also planning-like in that they 
    involve selecting means for actions to be performed now in ways that anticipate future actions  
    \citep{jeannerod_motor_2006,zhang:2007_planning,rosenbaum:2012_cognition}. 

+slide({bkg:'action_hierarchy_diagrams/Slide3.jpg'})
  .notes: :t
    Now in this action of moving a mug, there is a need, even for the single agent, to coordinate the 
    exchange between her two hands. 
    (If her action is fluid, 
    she may proactively adjust her left hand in advance of the mug’s being lifted by her right hand 
    \citep[compare][]{diedrichsen:2003_anticipatory,hugon:1982_anticipatory, lum:1992_feedforward}.) 
    How could such tight coordination be achieved? 
    Part of the answer involves the fact that motor representations and processes concerning the 
    actions involving each hand are not entirely independent of each other. 
    Rather there is a plan-like structure of motor representation for the whole action and motor 
    representations concerning actions involving each hand are components of this larger plan-like structure. 
    It is in part because they are components of a larger plan-like structure that the movements of 
    one hand constrain and are constrained by the movements of the other hand. 
  
+slide({bkg:'action_hierarchy_diagrams/Slide3.jpg'})
  .notes: :t
    We have just considered what is involved in performing an ordinary, individual action, where an agent 
    fills a glass from a bottle, taking one in each hand and moving them in a carefully coordinated way.
    Compare this individual action with the same action performed by two agents as a joint action.
    One agent takes the glass while the other takes the bottle.
    The joint action is like the individual action in several respects.

+slide({bkg:'action_hierarchy_diagrams/Slide4.jpg'})
  .notes First, the goal to which the joint action is directed is the same, namely to move the mug from here to there.

+slide({bkg:'action_hierarchy_diagrams/Slide5.jpg'})
  .notes: :t()
    Second, there is a similar coordination problem---the agents’ two hands have to meet.

+slide({bkg:'action_hierarchy_diagrams/Slide6.jpg'})
  .notes And, third, the evidence we have mentioned suggests that in joint action, motor representations and processes occur in each agent much like those that would occur if this agent were performing the whole action alone.
  .notes Why would this be helpful?  
  .notes &nbsp;
  .notes Suppose the agents' planning-like motor processes are similar enough that, in this context, they will reliably produce approximately the same plan-like structures of motor representations.
  .notes Then having a single planning-like motor process for the whole joint action in each agent means that
  .notes \begin{enumerate}
  .notes \item in each agent there is a plan-like structure of motor representations concerning each of the others’ actions,
  .notes \item each agent's plan-like structure concerning another's actions is approximately the same as any other agent's plan-like structure concerning those actions,
  .notes \item each agent's plan-like structure concerning her own actions is constrained by her plan-like structures concerning the other’s actions.
  .notes \end{enumerate}
  .notes So each agent’s plan-like structure of motor representations concerning her own actions is indirectly constrained by the other agents' plan-like structures concerning their own actions 
  .notes by virtue of being directly constrained by her plan-like structures concerning their actions.
  .notes In this way it is possible to use ordinary planning-like motor processes to achieve coordination in joint action.
  .notes What enables the two or more agents' plan-like structures of motor representations to mesh is not that they represent each other's plans but that they processes motorically each other's actions and their own as parts of a single action.
  .notes &nbsp;
  .notes   So how does the joint action differ from the corresponding individual action?  
  .notes There are at least two differences.  
  .notes First, we now have two plan-like structures of motor representations because in each agent there is a planning-like motor process concerning the whole action.
  .notes These two structures of motor representations have to be identical or similar enough that the differences don’t matter for the coordination of the agents’ actions---let us abbreviate this by saying that they have to \emph{match}.  
  .notes The need for matching planning-like structures is not specific to joint action;
  .notes it is also required where one agent observing another is able to predict her actions thanks to planning-like motor processes concerning the other’s actions (we mentioned evidence that this occurs above). 

+slide({bkg:'action_hierarchy_diagrams/Slide7.jpg'})
  .notes A second difference between the joint action and the individual action is this.
  .notes In joint action there are planning-like motor processes in each agent concerning some actions which she will not eventually perform. 
  .notes There must therefore be something that prevents part but not all of the planning-like motor process leading all the way to action.
  .notes Exactly how this selective prevention works is an open question.
  .notes We expect bodily and environmental constraints are often relevant. 
  .notes There may also be differences in how others’ actions are processed motorically \citep[compare][]{novembre:2012_distinguishing}.
  .notes \footnote{\citep[p.\ 2901]{novembre:2012_distinguishing}: 'in the context of a joint action—the motor control system is particularly sensitive to the identity of the agent (self or other) of a represented action and that (social) contextual information is one means for achieving this distinction'}
  .notes And inhibition could be involved too \citep[compare][]{sebanz:2006_twin_peaks}.
  .slide
    +blur('img:eq(0)')
    +fade('img:eq(0)')
    .notes: :t
       My proposal, then, is this.
       In both practical reasoning and motorically, sometimes agents are able to achieve coordination
        for joint action not by representing each others’ plans but 
        by treating each other's actions and their own as if they were parts of a single action.
    .notes: :t
      So perhaps joint action is not always only a matter of intention, knowledge or commitment: 
      perhaps sometimes joint action constitutively involves motor representation.

  p.center.huge-glow conclusion
  .notes: :t
    In conclusion, my question was about in virtue of what ... collective goals.
    Many researchers have answered this question by appeal to one or another kind of shared intention.
    What we have shown is that in some cases the right answer to the question involves 
    motor representation rather than intention.
    And, more tentatively, this suggests that there may be a role for motor representation
    in characterising joint action.
    Perhaps understanding joint action and shared intention requires appeal not just to intention, commitment and the rest,
    but also to motor representation.
