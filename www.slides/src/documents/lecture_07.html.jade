    My topic is mindreading, the process of identifying mental states and purposive actions as
    the mental states and purposive actions of a particular subject.
  .notes: :t
    Let me start with a canonical illustration of mindreading in action.

    p.center.hide.step2 Which box will Maxi look in?
  +left_half
    p.center Mindreading

    p.center Not Mindreading

    p.hide.step2 Maxi wants his chocolate.
  +right_half
    p Chocolate is good.

      So where the nonmindreader uses facts to generate predictions about actions, the
      mindreading attributes beliefs.
  .slide
    +unhighlight-row('.belief')
    +highlight-row('.prediction')
    .notes: :t
      In many cases, you will get the same predictions whether you are mindreading
      or just using facts.  But in cases like this, where there are false belief,
      the predictions can come apart.
      \textbf{This means that we can detect mindreading by measuring action predictions.}

      In what follows I’m going to focus on belief.
    .notes: :t
      The existence of mindreading processes for tracking beliefs raises many questions:
    .notes.handout: :t
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item Why is belief-tracking in adults sometimes but not always automatic? (or automatic to varying
      degrees) 
      \item How and why is automatic belief-tracking limited in ways that nonautomatic belief-tracking is not?
      \item How and why are inhibition, attention and working memory involved in belief-tracking?
      
      \item Why is there an age at which children pass some false belief tasks but systematically fail
      others? 
      \item What feature or features distinguish the tasks these children fail from those they
      pass?
      
      \end{enumerate}
    
    .notes: :t
      I think there is more than one kind of mindreading process which tracks beliefs.
      That’s why my title is ...

    p.center.huge-glow-120 conclusion

  +slide_middle
    .hem-around-children
      p Some but not all mindreading is automatic.
      p.slide: :t
        [Dual process] automatic and nonautomatic mindreading processes are distinct
        in that whether they occur and which ascriptions they yield depends on different conditions.
      p.slide: :t
        [Speed-Accuracy] automatic and nonautomatic mindreading processes allow us to make
        complementary speed-accuracy trade offs.
      p.slide: :t
        Automatic mindreading trades accuracy for speed by virtue of involving a noncanonical
        model of minds and actions.
      p.slide: :t
        And this noncanonical model is specified by minimal theory of mind.

      p Conjecture
      .hem-around-children
        p Nonhuman mindreading processes resemble automatic mindreading processes in humans
        p and are characterised by minimal theory of mind.
    +right_half({step:true})
      p Predictions
      .no-hem-around-children
        p Nonhuman mindreading ...
        p ... has signature limits in common with nonhuman mindreading.
        p ... is affected by conditions affecting automatic mindreading in humans (eg. delays).
        p ... is unaffected by conditions not affecting  ... (eg. time constraints).
        p ... creates altercentric interference.
