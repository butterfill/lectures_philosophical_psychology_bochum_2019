//- TOOD
//- Jack : Red things do not differ in visual appearance from non-red things *in virtue of their redness*. (clearly the do in virtue of their shades)
//- John : stress common effect.  It may not be learning the colour words as such, but something involved in learning them, that influences categorical colour perception.

  .notes: :t
    What is the proper domain of a philosopher of mind?
  .notes: :t
    I’m tempted to think that there isn’t one:
    almost any philosophical views about minds or actions depend on claims that
    are experimentally falsifiable.
  .notes: :t
    People sometimes say claims about phenomenology are immune: they
    really can’t be tested. Let’s see ...
  .notes: :t
    This is a module on Puzzling Questions about Minds in Action.
    I want to consider a range of cases in which scientific findings 
    create the sort of puzzles that philosophers seem well-placed 
    to grapple with.
  .notes: :t
    My plan is to cover a range of topics, as listed on the course outline.
    There are several themes that are more or less independent of each other.
    I wanted to start with a question about colour experiences because 
    partly this is a fun introduction.
    The other lectures aren’t closely related to this one: I’m guessing that
    some people won’t realise the module starts in week 1.
