    You can drag the slider to show them that it's full overlap, but first ask them what they see.]

          Normally in this case people report the impression that the top sequence collided.
          That is, they didn't pass, they collided.

    Contrast shape with monetary value.
    People sometimes talk about being able to detect monetary value.
    Presumably we perceive visual characteristics and infer monetary value.

    Consider causal interactions. 
    Where do they fit in?
    Are they perceptually 
    experienced in whatever sense the shape and motions of things are?

    So, in conclusion,  
    Where do  causal interactions fit in?
    Are they perceptually
